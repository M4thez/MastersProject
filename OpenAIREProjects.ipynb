Today’s business executives prefer processing information through non-text formats, including infographics, photos, graphic storytelling and video and both the influential enGauge report and the EU’s work on digital media literacy has established the importance of visual literacy in the 21st century because of its relation to critical thinking and learning to learn.The topic is especially relevant to engineering education, across all disciplines from mechanical and electrical engineering, to automotive, environmental and computer engineering. While sketching was traditionally used to cultivate spatial reasoning and problem solving, the recent digital technology transformation has rekindled debate how today’s engineers should use the myriad digital tools available to them. Put simply, engineering is a strategic sector in European economies driving innovation and growth. If we want our engineers to be more creative, productive and competitive, and produce more value for our economy and society, we can do through improved visual literacy. Yet, paradoxically and worryingly, visual skills are almost entirely absent from engineering curricula. Updating research carried out by our colleagues at UPM, in 2018 the NOT team found only two European HEIs that offer engineering graphics courses linked to creativity and that visual literacy is entirely absent from engineering VET. OBJECTIVEHence, the objective of our project is clear: strengthen the visual literacy of engineers across participating countries and further afield by introducing innovative visual literacy training into our vocational teaching and provision.  ACTIVITIESTo achieve our objectives, we will undertake the following activities: Catalogue and communicate the specific visual competences that most contribute to engineers’ creativity and productivity by producing the VLEE Competence Framework - so that stakeholders and VET organizations are motivated to introduce this new element of teaching. Carry out rigorous testing to determine the most relevant, useful and easy-to-use digital graphic, image and video technology and share this knowledge with the VET sector so that engineering teachers have the knowledge, skills and resources to improve teaching and learning using visual content - VLEE Toolkit. Produce the first visual literacy for engineering VET training course to enable engineers to develop their visual competences in a very practical manner - VLEE online course.PARTICIPANT PROFILEThe project will respond to the following needs of these target groups: i) ENGINEERS. Students attending vocational colleges and working engineers need practical training opportunities to become better at problem solving, innovation and communication, and to stay up-to-date with the technologies affecting their sector ii) VET TRAINERS need support in modernizing their pedagogic approach and strategic use of digital technology in ways that better cater to students’ learning needs and future performance in the workplace.   iii) VET ORGANIZATIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS, from technical colleges to professional membership bodies, education policy makers, need cost-effective, scalable solutions to improving the quality of education and its relevance to real life work skills.RESULTSWe will produce 3 main results:1 Visual Literacy for Engineering COMPETENCE FRAMEWORK, a digital publication that introduces our target groups to the concept and benefits of visual literacy education and the digital innovations that help teach it effectively. 2 VLEE TOOLKIT, an interactive publication providing practical guidance on the top 20 digital technologies, tools or platforms can be used to teach different aspects of visual literacy in engineering and advance students’ visual competences.3 Visual Literacy for Engineering ONLINE COURSE, a multilingual e-learning course &amp; user driven platform which consolidates learning for students who have received classroom teaching, and enables distance/flexible learning for engineers already in employment irrespective of age, level of study or geographic location.IMPACTVLEE has been carefully structured to enable VET Schools &amp; providers of professional education for engineers to better respond to labour market needs by enabling the introduction of high quality visual literacy education for engineers. All of our project’s outputs, combined with our dissemination/exploitation strategy, are focussed on both raising awareness of this gap, &amp; equipping educators with the means to better teach these competences. As a result, thousands more engineers will have the skills they need to flourish in an ever-changing labour market.Furthermore, the unique structure of the VLEE project provides a reliable means of introducing and scaling improved visual literacy competences for engineering students &amp; engineers in the workplace across Europe.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 248028.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::f92bfce1bb4183f66d6b4d6925fdfe2a', 'code': '101084549', 'acronym': 'SAFE', 'title': 'SmartAqua4FuturE - SAFE', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2022-11-01', 'endDate': '2026-10-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Integrated and sustainable freshwater bioeconomy: Combining aquaculture, biodiversity preservation, biotechnology and other uses'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The objective of SAFE project is to reduce the environmental impact and improve the viability of the FW aquaculture by applying circular economy approaches to the valorisation of solid and liquid wastes from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and integThe main objective of SAFE project is to reduce the environmental impact and improve the viability of the FW aquaculture by applying circular economy (CE) approaches to the valorisation of solid and liquid wastes from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems.

The lack of female entrepreneurs is particularly evident in the field of Engineering. Despite high profile role models, overall female innovativeness and participation in the engineering sector have decreased, and ‘an unconscious bias’ still prevails.Poland, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Turkey are among the countries that have introduced measures to improve the institutional framework for female enterprise, but more needs to be done to overcome individual barriers, making sure that sure the small but growing number of females studying/working in Engineering are helped to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and build their business skills. The problem is that our VET and HEI institutions are ill-equipped to do so: most are unspecialized in the specific strategies that are shown to work best with female entrepreneurs; their staff is trained in generic/traditional business models (not Engineering specific) and they are not connected to universities/HE institutions to recruit graduate females emerging from Engineering subjects.The EMERGE online community, learning resources, and training events connect users to expert knowledge and advice.

However, in today’s labour market, it is estimated that 90% of ALL jobs require ICT skills (www.idc.com) since rapid innovation in ICT is leading to “the need for digital skills in nearly all jobs where ICT complements existing tasks.” (EC Digital Single Market texts) Nevertheless, 47% of the EU population is not properly digitally skilled and this is even more noticeable in Poland, where 54% of the population have no or low digital skills. (EC Digital Single Market publications). Indeed, Poland ranks last among OECD countries with less than 20% of all workers using office software daily.  For these reasons, the Digital Skills Accelerator (DSA) project aims to put students in the driving seat of their own skills development. The goal of the project is clear: define the digital skills that should be prioritized by current and future cohorts of HE students, and create a self-directed multi-media learning system that students can access to bolster their skills in specific areas.      In order to achieve this goal, we will:  - Produce a DIGITAL SKILLS REPORT (IO1) identifying the most valuable digital skills required professionally and for civic engagement.  - Create an ONLINE SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL (IO2) enabling students to identify their digital skills’ profile and map a personalized learning pathway.  - Develop the ESSENTIAL DIGITAL SKILLS TOOLKIT (IO3), an open, online modular training course allowing students to update their skills in the key areas. - Produce a series of MOTIVATION AND RECRUITMENT VIDEOS (IO4) as an essential component of the recruitment and learning process. - Rigorously test and optimize the resources before disseminating them widely to ensure strong use among the target groups.  The DSA model is based heavily on the concepts of user based design and so it is only reasonable that our project should integrate as much user participation as possible at all stages, from design to execution to evaluation, specifically:  - 50+ HE institutions, VET institutions and wider stakeholders will participate in the DIGITAL SKILLS RESEARCH REPORT - 36 teaching staff from HEIs &amp;VET institutions and 60 HE students participate in USER TESTING -  12 + Students and/or other organizations will have their video CASE STUDY developed  - 250 HE and VET institutions and wider stakeholders will participate in MULTIPLIER EVENTS  On completion, the DSA project will have produced the knowledge, resources and social capital (commitment from key actors) to enable the introduction of the Digital Skills and Competences model to our HE and VET institutions, and through them to present and future generations of digital confident citizens.   In order to achieve this overall impact, the project will produce 4 intellectual outputs (IOs) which each focus on producing a tangible result or output. 1 Digital skills research report (IO1) identifying and prioritize information for digital competences 1 Self-Assessment tool (IO2) students will use this interactive self-assessment tool to identify their current digital skills profile. 1 Essential Digital Skills Toolkit (IO3) - a comprehensive training course of circa 18 modules to assist students to updates their skills in the key areas.   1 set of Motivation and Recruitment Videos (IO4)  The tangible results will lead to the following outcomes: - TEACHING STAFF in HE institutions in 4 regions will grow in knowledge and skills, being able to integrate digital skills into their courses. - HE STUDENTS, will develop digital competences and skills for application in their professional lives.   - HE AND VET INSTITUTIONS AND WIDER STAKEHOLDERS will demonstrate greater commitment to support its implementation in education - WIDER STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICY MAKERS   will gain greater awareness, knowledge and integration of Digital Competences as a new and important aspect of education. - PROJECT PARTNERS will acquire in depth knowledge of digital competences   The impact of the project will be felt most at local and regional level through the strengthening of digital skills teaching and the ability of thousands of students to engage with the outputs of the project, thereby advancing their own digital literacy and competences.  However, it also provides a reliable means of advancing systemic changes in approaches to digital skills education at national and international levels given the high relevance both of digital skills to the demands of our contemporary European economy, but also of digital literacy in these #fakenews times.  Moreover, it demonstrates that there are many new and innovative ways to increase the social inclusion and civic engagement of young people, while also contributing to the overall European goal of social cohesion.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 193064.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}]\n",

Today’s business executives prefer processing information through non-text formats, including infographics, photos, graphic storytelling and video and both the influential enGauge report and the EU’s work on digital media literacy has established the importance of visual literacy in the 21st century because of its relation to critical thinking and learning to learn.The topic is especially relevant to engineering education, across all disciplines from mechanical and electrical engineering, to automotive, environmental and computer engineering. While sketching was traditionally used to cultivate spatial reasoning and problem solving, the recent digital technology transformation has rekindled debate how today’s engineers should use the myriad digital tools available to them. Put simply, engineering is a strategic sector in European economies driving innovation and growth. If we want our engineers to be more creative, productive and competitive, and produce more value for our economy and society, we can do through improved visual literacy. Yet, paradoxically and worryingly, visual skills are almost entirely absent from engineering curricula. Updating research carried out by our colleagues at UPM, in 2018 the NOT team found only two European HEIs that offer engineering graphics courses linked to creativity and that visual literacy is entirely absent from engineering VET. OBJECTIVEHence, the objective of our project is clear: strengthen the visual literacy of engineers across participating countries and further afield by introducing innovative visual literacy training into our vocational teaching and provision.  ACTIVITIESTo achieve our objectives, we will undertake the following activities: Catalogue and communicate the specific visual competences that most contribute to engineers’ creativity and productivity by producing the VLEE Competence Framework - so that stakeholders and VET organizations are motivated to introduce this new element of teaching. Carry out rigorous testing to determine the most relevant, useful and easy-to-use digital graphic, image and video technology and share this knowledge with the VET sector so that engineering teachers have the knowledge, skills and resources to improve teaching and learning using visual content - VLEE Toolkit. Produce the first visual literacy for engineering VET training course to enable engineers to develop their visual competences in a very practical manner - VLEE online course.PARTICIPANT PROFILEThe project will respond to the following needs of these target groups: i) ENGINEERS. Students attending vocational colleges and working engineers need practical training opportunities to become better at problem solving, innovation and communication, and to stay up-to-date with the technologies affecting their sector ii) VET TRAINERS need support in modernizing their pedagogic approach and strategic use of digital technology in ways that better cater to students’ learning needs and future performance in the workplace.   iii) VET ORGANIZATIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS, from technical colleges to professional membership bodies, education policy makers, need cost-effective, scalable solutions to improving the quality of education and its relevance to real life work skills.RESULTSWe will produce 3 main results:1 Visual Literacy for Engineering COMPETENCE FRAMEWORK, a digital publication that introduces our target groups to the concept and benefits of visual literacy education and the digital innovations that help teach it effectively. 2 VLEE TOOLKIT, an interactive publication providing practical guidance on the top 20 digital technologies, tools or platforms can be used to teach different aspects of visual literacy in engineering and advance students’ visual competences.3 Visual Literacy for Engineering ONLINE COURSE, a multilingual e-learning course &amp; user driven platform which consolidates learning for students who have received classroom teaching, and enables distance/flexible learning for engineers already in employment irrespective of age, level of study or geographic location.IMPACTVLEE has been carefully structured to enable VET Schools &amp; providers of professional education for engineers to better respond to labour market needs by enabling the introduction of high quality visual literacy education for engineers. All of our project’s outputs, combined with our dissemination/exploitation strategy, are focussed on both raising awareness of this gap, &amp; equipping educators with the means to better teach these competences. As a result, thousands more engineers will have the skills they need to flourish in an ever-changing labour market.Furthermore, the unique structure of the VLEE project provides a reliable means of introducing and scaling improved visual literacy competences for engineering students &amp; engineers in the workplace across Europe.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 248028.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::f92bfce1bb4183f66d6b4d6925fdfe2a', 'code': '101084549', 'acronym': 'SAFE', 'title': 'SmartAqua4FuturE - SAFE', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2022-11-01', 'endDate': '2026-10-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Integrated and sustainable freshwater bioeconomy: Combining aquaculture, biodiversity preservation, biotechnology and other uses'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The objective of SAFE project is to reduce the environmental impact and improve the viability of the FW aquaculture by applying circular economy approaches to the valorisation of solid and liquid wastes from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and integThe main objective of SAFE project is to reduce the environmental impact and improve the viability of the FW aquaculture by applying circular economy (CE) approaches to the valorisation of solid and liquid wastes from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems.

The problem is that our VET and HEI institutions are ill-equipped to do so: most are unspecialized in the specific strategies that are shown to work best with female entrepreneurs; their staff is trained in generic/traditional business models (not Engineering specific) and they are not connected to universities/HE institutions to recruit graduate females emerging from Engineering subjects.The EMERGE online community, learning resources, and training events connect users to expert knowledge and advice.

However, in today’s labour market, it is estimated that 90% of ALL jobs require ICT skills (www.idc.com) since rapid innovation in ICT is leading to “the need for digital skills in nearly all jobs where ICT complements existing tasks.” (EC Digital Single Market texts) Nevertheless, 47% of the EU population is not properly digitally skilled and this is even more noticeable in Poland, where 54% of the population have no or low digital skills. (EC Digital Single Market publications). Indeed, Poland ranks last among OECD countries with less than 20% of all workers using office software daily.  For these reasons, the Digital Skills Accelerator (DSA) project aims to put students in the driving seat of their own skills development. The goal of the project is clear: define the digital skills that should be prioritized by current and future cohorts of HE students, and create a self-directed multi-media learning system that students can access to bolster their skills in specific areas.      In order to achieve this goal, we will:  - Produce a DIGITAL SKILLS REPORT (IO1) identifying the most valuable digital skills required professionally and for civic engagement.  - Create an ONLINE SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL (IO2) enabling students to identify their digital skills’ profile and map a personalized learning pathway.  - Develop the ESSENTIAL DIGITAL SKILLS TOOLKIT (IO3), an open, online modular training course allowing students to update their skills in the key areas. - Produce a series of MOTIVATION AND RECRUITMENT VIDEOS (IO4) as an essential component of the recruitment and learning process. - Rigorously test and optimize the resources before disseminating them widely to ensure strong use among the target groups.  The DSA model is based heavily on the concepts of user based design and so it is only reasonable that our project should integrate as much user participation as possible at all stages, from design to execution to evaluation, specifically:  - 50+ HE institutions, VET institutions and wider stakeholders will participate in the DIGITAL SKILLS RESEARCH REPORT - 36 teaching staff from HEIs &amp;VET institutions and 60 HE students participate in USER TESTING -  12 + Students and/or other organizations will have their video CASE STUDY developed  - 250 HE and VET institutions and wider stakeholders will participate in MULTIPLIER EVENTS  On completion, the DSA project will have produced the knowledge, resources and social capital (commitment from key actors) to enable the introduction of the Digital Skills and Competences model to our HE and VET institutions, and through them to present and future generations of digital confident citizens.   In order to achieve this overall impact, the project will produce 4 intellectual outputs (IOs) which each focus on producing a tangible result or output. 1 Digital skills research report (IO1) identifying and prioritize information for digital competences 1 Self-Assessment tool (IO2) students will use this interactive self-assessment tool to identify their current digital skills profile. 1 Essential Digital Skills Toolkit (IO3) - a comprehensive training course of circa 18 modules to assist students to updates their skills in the key areas.   1 set of Motivation and Recruitment Videos (IO4)  The tangible results will lead to the following outcomes: - TEACHING STAFF in HE institutions in 4 regions will grow in knowledge and skills, being able to integrate digital skills into their courses. - HE STUDENTS, will develop digital competences and skills for application in their professional lives.   - HE AND VET INSTITUTIONS AND WIDER STAKEHOLDERS will demonstrate greater commitment to support its implementation in education - WIDER STAKEHOLDERS AND POLICY MAKERS   will gain greater awareness, knowledge and integration of Digital Competences as a new and important aspect of education. - PROJECT PARTNERS will acquire in depth knowledge of digital competences   The impact of the project will be felt most at local and regional level through the strengthening of digital skills teaching and the ability of thousands of students to engage with the outputs of the project, thereby advancing their own digital literacy and competences.

Currently although great progress has been achieved for carbon-based supercapacitors, which are still limited by complicated or environmentally-unfriendly synthesis procedure, unsatisfied structure and low energy density, it is still remaining a grand challenge to prepare heteroatoms-doped three-dimensional (3D) carbon network as supercapacitive electrodes with superior electrochemistry performances via a low-cost, easily scalable and eco-friendly methods. To achieve this goal, inspired by the features of intumescent flame retardants (IFRs), including rich in heteroatoms (N, P), thermos-crosslinking, tailored composition and easy carbonization to form porous char, a self-assembling and self-activation strategy is proposed to produce N/P Dual-doped 3D Carbon Network by nano-CaCO3 template-assistant carbonization of IFRs.

In order to prevent the spread of the virus, while schools were mostly closed by country decisions, teaching and learning processes had to be organized online. Many European countries have continued their education with distance education. However, the worldwide use of digital content in education was relatively rare before the COVID outbreak began. Only 20% of the countries had digital learning resources in teaching (World bank datas, 2020). With the need for distance education that has become more apparent with Covid, the need for digitally prepared course materials and contents has increased. Education and training disruption due to the closure of schools negatively affected the personal development of students. In this process, the lack of innovative content and innovative areas has not yet been filled. Especially in the field of artificial intelligence, which is called the profession of the future, digital content that has an innovative content and can teach by making applications is very lacking. Our project contributes to the development of digital learning materials and tools such as Open Education Resources. Our project also has qualifications to support new teaching methods and tools, and has the awareness and use of European frameworks in the digital competence of educators, students and organizations.The topic of artificial intelligence is currently one of the most popular science fields in the world. The researches and future artificial intelligence predictions show that artificial intelligence will have a great importance in shaping the future. The USA and China continue to lead the world in this regard. However, with the plans and strategies of the European commission, it will show itself in this game in Europe. The Commission and Member States agreed to join forces on AI policy and investment in 2018. The revised Coordinated Plan on AI was published in April 2021. Maximising resources and coordinating investments is a critical component of the Commission's AI strategy. Through the Digital Europe and Horizon Europe programs, the Commission plans to invest € 1 billion per year in AI. It will mobilise additional investments from the private sector and the Member States in order to reach an annual investment volume of € 20 billion over the course of this decade. And, the newly adopted Recovery and Resilience Facility makes € 134 billion available for digital and will be a game-changer, allowing Europe to amplify its ambitions and become a global leader in developing cutting-edge, trustworthy AI.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;These developments in artificial intelligence also show the size and importance of the subject. Working in the field of artificial intelligence technologies individually or institutionally is very difficult in terms of skills. Cooperation is inevitable in this regard. However, since the competencies of each institution differ, it does not seem possible institutionally to reveal important components such as training materials related to artificial intelligence. We want to bring together the strengths of institutions and to develop innovative training materials that meet the needs of the workforce by blending their skills.Therefore,our project focuses on the application of a gamification concept to artificial intelligence training for distance learning,in order to improve the overall student characteristic for motivation and participation in online courses.An assessment system will be designed to follow the student's progress and students will be guided with the necessary feedback.For these reasons, our project goal is:•To train students with the qualifications that the workforce is looking for•Developing the proficiency of teachers and students in the field of AI•Cooperating between Higher Edu,VET and SMEs•Development of digital skills and distance education at the education and training level•To promote continuing vocational education and training with easy access to content through our distance learning platform•To ensure that the skills and abilities of current students are compatible with the basic skills and abilities in the labor market• Ensuring and encouraging cooperation in the field of Vocational Education and Higher Education•To train qualified manpower that can lead research in the field of AI at vocational school, associate degree and undergraduate level and to encourage the European digital industry level•Supporting strong partnerships between business and educational institutions&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;We planned 7 work packages to run the project.1) Management of Project2) Development of O13) Development of O24) Development of O35) Sustainability of Project6) Dissemination and Exploitation of Project7) Monitoring and Evaluation of Project&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;Tangible Results:- A gamification interfaces designed for e-learning platform will be developed (O1). - A curricula for Artificial Intelligence (O2)- An assessment system will be developed (O3).Intangible Results:1- Information increase has been achieved:* Increased knowledge on measurement and evaluation systems and artificial intelligence applications in countries.* Increased knowledge on project management, employee assignment, and financial management.2- Competency has been increased:* Increased awareness of artificial intelligence has been provided* The number of people who pay attention to the importance of artificial intelligence and future studies has also contributed to the increase in competence.* Increasing the institutional capacity has been achieved by increasing the number of people who can work in the field of artificial intelligence.* Personal personal skills are developed to enter employment.* A qualified assessment and evaluation system has been developed.* Institutional capacity was increased.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 168090.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::ef27579d7c9ebd22228a183bbd038bbb', 'code': '2021-1-IE02-KA220-HED-000032236', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Fostering Innovation in Community Led Enterprise Development', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'Community development; Development of training courses; Enterprise, industry, SMEs and entrepreneurship', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': \"&lt;&lt; Background &gt;&gt;The ComEnt project aims at developing a blended learning educational programme and associated teaching / learning resources for higher education institutions; accrediting agencies; and social entrepreneurs / innovators on the innovative topic of community enterprise development. The fostering of community-led and community owned enterprises promotes civic engagement. The knowledge, skillsets and competencies acquired through this initiative will enable university graduates and social innovators to empower marginalised groups and disadvantaged locations. This provides the capacity to create wealth and promote social inclusion, particularly for those who have been less successful in engaging with the dominant neo-liberal and capitalist market system.An enterprising community is not simply concerned with capitalism but seeks to build a viable and sustainable social, economic and cultural ecosystem. Enterprising communities involve an integrated mix of social, private and state enterprise, each adding value to the other. According to Cooke (2018), there are sufficient resources (live and dormant) owned by statutory agencies; community and voluntary sector; and private sector which could be utilised productively to create and sustain community-owned social enterprises. The ComEnt project defines a community enterprise as an organisation owned and managed by the community, whose mission and vison are centred on serving individuals from a defined geographical area (predominantly disadvantaged locations) and / or communities of interest (predominantly marginalised groups in society). This makes community enterprises a distinct group within the wider social enterprise sector, not only trading for social purposes but reinvesting any profits in ways that provide benefits to a particular community. According to the European Commission (2021) ‘being entrepreneurial is a valuable skill for EU citizens, both for their personal and professional development. Entrepreneurship education plays a key role for Europe’s competiveness and for the continuous growth of Europe’s economy’. Furthermore, Council Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (2018), ‘promoting entrepreneurship in education as a key competence as it encourages EU citizens to be enterprising and to formulate innovative solutions to societal problems and to design products of added socio-economic value’. Therefore, the specific promotion of community sponsored entrepreneurism within higher education courses is innovative.It is critically important for higher education institutions, in partnership with the community and voluntary sector, to undertake research on the topic of community enterprise. Furthermore, it is equally important to educate students and relevant stakeholders on the ways in which community owned enterprises can facilitate community-led local development. The ComEnt project's overall impact contributes to the fulfilment of specific ERASMUS+ priorities. These include: increased sense of initiative and entrepreneurship; increased level of digital competence; improved levels of skills for employability and new business creation (including social entrepreneurship); improved competences, linked to occupational profile; and increased opportunities for professional development.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;Overall, this project wishes to equip stakeholders with the necessary knowledge, skillsets and competencies to develop and enhance the development of community owned and community-led enterprises, which would be an innovative approach to fostering social inclusion amongst marginalized groups and disadvantaged areas across Europe. Ultimately, the stimulation of this kind of thinking and the development of a competent body of practitioners throughout Europe will lead to an increase in this particular form of community development which is enterprise and employment focused; seeks to unlock and enable the use of dormant community assets; and provide locally-focused goods and services which will have a social cohesion purpose and impact.The key objectives of the ComEnt project are: •To identify and reflect on best practice examples of successful community enterprise and determine their critical success factors. • To develop and enhance the knowledge, skillsets and competencies of learners on the concepts of community-led local development and community owned enterprises; and to apply an empowering and consultative framework in encouraging communities to become ‘enterprising’. •To develop a course syllabus and associated teaching and learning resources, with a possible focus on: community enterprise models / approaches; leadership, human resources and operational management in community enterprise; governance / legal entity frameworks; and finance. •To engage with higher education institutions. policymakers and relevant community development  stakeholders with regard to replicating this innovative educational programme on completion of the project.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;The main intellectual outputs of the ComEnt project include: RO1 National and summary reports on the state of the art on innovative models of community enterprise development. RO2 Course syllabus and associated teaching / learning materials RO3 Project website and learning repository. RO4 Evaluation, Testing and Optimization Other activities include:Learning, teaching and training activities will take place during the developmental phases of the project (LTT1 - LTT2), when the blended learning course materials will be developed and tested by project partners. Local Conferences (E1-E5) – CCJ, ADV, AdM, FHV and BFU will organize and deliver a local conference to audiences (40) drawn from the target groups for the project in which RO1, RO2, R03 and RO4 will be showcased and opportunities provided for hands-on trial and testing of the educational resources. Similarly ACEEU will organize and host a European conference (E6) and provide similar opportunities.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;On completion of the ComEnt project, it is envisaged that the following will be achieved: − a stronger awareness among academics, students and policymakers about the nature, purpose, barriers and enablers for the different models of community enterprise development; − comprehensive information flows between the community and voluntary sector; higher education institutions, statutory agencies; and private sector (quadruple helix) on the necessity for improved levels of skills for employability and new business creation (including social and community entrepreneurship);− a shared understanding among researchers; lecturers; graduates; and community and voluntary sector on the knowledge, skills and competency requirements for empowering social entrepreneurs to promote sustainable community-owned enterprises and employment. -An innovative accredited on-line / blended special purpose award (15 ECTS) and associated educational materials on community enterprise.

Student self-governments are underused as the potential of intellectual resource. Young people are not informed and do not participate in the problem solving and decision-making connected with life of educational institution. Not all schools or educational institutions are interested in the development of student self-government, considering that it is extra work.In general, the risk of early school leaving will increase in all EU countries. The project offer the solutions to the problem. Student self-governments, increasing the efficiency of their work, will improve work with young people from groups of social risk and reduce the risk of early school leaving.Project objectives: to improve and intensify the work of student self-governments with young people, thus increasing the capacity and work efficiency of student self-governments and reducing the risk of early school leaving.Profile and number of participants: * 78 young people were involved and trained during mobilities. There had been planned to involve 98 young people but some young people participated in the mobilities several times therefore the number of people and mobilities does not match.* approximately 300 young people took part in activities planned by partner organizations * 29 teachers were involved in the mobilities. There had been planned that 48 teachers take part in mobilities but some teachers participated in mobilities several times. There was a requirement that the project coordinator participates in all visits so the number of people does not match with number of mobilities.*7 partner organizations (Bulgaria (a higher educational institution), Macedonia (NGO), Hungary (NGO), Romania (vocational educational institution), Turkey (educational institution), Portugal (professional educational institution), Latvia - coordinator (the general educational institution) participated in the project.The project activities were planned and implemented in two ways:Direction 1 - Training actions within mobility during which representatives of student self-governments and teachers, have acquired in-depth knowledge, skills and competences in a certain field.The methods have been used: \"\"ice-breaking\"\" activities, discussions, role-plays, tests for self-studying, interviews with representatives of various professions, visiting social institutions, excursions to companies, local and state government and manufacturing companies, charity campaigns, organization of various events, writing scripts and conducting events, making videos, activities of group formation and consolidation, organization of events, workshops, training, etc. All planned methods have been implemented as it had been planned and written in the application of the project.2nd direction - the activities held by the young people of the partner organizations, who had been trained within mobilities, in their institutions. The acquired knowledge / skills / abilities have been used to acquaint young people of their institutions with knowledge gained during mobilities.Description of the project results * 208 detailed handouts were created* The presentations include descriptions of situation in different countries, statistical data, theoretical guidelines and conclusions; all interested have access to these materials * Young people who have been trained during mobilities continue working in their own schools and institutions, informing other young people about the project results and involving them into activities; the total number - more than 1000 young people from all partner organizations  Effects * It was planned that around 50% of young people from groups of social risk will be motivated to continue learning and to acquire the selected educational or another programs in all the partner organizations due to project activities. At poll of the partner organizations we have come to a conclusion that it is difficult to define whether young people are motivated to continue study, thanks to activities of the project as it is a difficult question. But all coordinators and the involved teachers have recognized that the interest of young people has increased, some young people have begun to show interest in requirements which have to be executed to have an opportunity to participate in foreign mobilities, to get acquainted with the culture of other countries, to learn something new.* After the project results  are in open access and available for public, the staff of other educational and social institutions, members of student self-governments and young people will be interested in the project experience learning and its practical application in their own institutions – many representatives of various schools and institutions individually were interested in opportunities of the use of the project materials; many also were interested in possible contacts with partners of the project* Young people from groups of social risk have been encouraged to participate in activities that are organized by various educational institutions and NGOs.Long-term benefits *Young people will be motivated to continue or resume the formal education or also to increase motivation for education and development of career.\"', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 147944.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::85438a253ba0092decf2f719d2718288', 'code': '2019-1-RO01-KA205-062434', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Digital Heroes', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'ICT - new technologies - digital competences; New innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': '\"Through this project we want to engage youth in a maker, hands-on, learning-by-doing education. The challenges we identified are:- Humanity is facing major challenges: from health issues, to food insecurity, habitat and biodiversity loss, water scarcity. - The tech industry is growing and evolving at a rapid pace. Unfortunately, it is given insufficient attention to technical education, therefore we do not have enough people skilled in science, technology, engineering and math.There\\'s a technological and creative revolution underway. Technology is shaping how our world is changing and how we educate young generations nowadays. Amazing new tools, materials and skills turn us all into makers. Using technology to make, repair or customize the things we need brings engineering, design and computer science to the masses. This maker movement overlaps with the natural inclinations of youth and the power of learning by doing. The active learner is at the center of the learning process, amplifying the best traditions of progressive education. Children are natural tinkerers. Their seminal learning experiences come through direct experience with materials. Digital fabrication, such as 3D printing and physical computing, including Arduino, Makey Makey and Raspberry Pi, expands a child\\'s toy and toolboxes with new ways to make things and new things to make. For the first time ever, childhood inventions may be printed, programmed or imbued with interactivity. Recycled materials can be brought back to life. While school traditionally separates art and science, theory and practice, such divisions are artificial. The real world just doesn\\'t work that way Architects are artists. Craftsmen deal in aesthetics, tradition and mathematical precision. Video game developers rely on computer science. Engineering and industrial design are inseparable. The finest scientists are often accomplished musicians. The maker movement blurs the artificial boundaries between subject areas, it erases distinctions between art and science. Given all mentioned, the solution we propose through this project is to use all this technology and the maker movement itself to create solutions for the challenges we face, a STEAM, maker oriented approach, that will inspire and engage young people into design thinking, critical thinking, collaboration. Prototypes examples we aim to inspire youth to create during the 2020 and 2021 mobility programs: Monitor Air Pollution, Water Pollution Monitor, Heart Rate Monitor.Mobility program duration: 8 weeks in 2020 and 8 weeks in 2021, 16 participants/ week (targeting youth from 14 to 25 years old), in July – August 2020 and 2021. Each group of students will attend the program for 2 consecutive weeks, so they engage in plenty of tech related activities and deepen their skills. After the 2 weeks, each group will enroll in a mentorship program with the objective of improving, scaling and marketing their prototype.Prior of the mobility programs in 2020 and 2021, the consortium will work intensively on a maker curriculum targeting youth aged 14 to 25. We believe maker education should move into the mainstream. We will outline how making is a rigorous process that leads to valuable new technologies, products and experiences. Specifically, we will show clearly the kinds of knowledge, skills and practices students learn as part of making. The shift to \"\"making\"\" represents the perfect storm of new technological materials, expanded opportunities, learning through firsthand experience, and the basic human impulse to create. It offers the potential to make the educational experience more learner-centered: relevant and more sensitive to each learner\\'s remarkable capacity for intensity. The project objectives:- Introduce youth and young students to maker education- Help youth develop digital literacy and other useful skills (e.g. 21st century skills) to tackle challenges stemming from professional sector, but also environmental issues and challenges our society is facing- Improve the digital skills of youth so that they can play an active role in our modern society- Inspire youth to become ambassador of modern pedagogies and constructivist teaching methods among individuals of the same ageThe main activities:- Infrastructural preparation: arrangements for the two mobility activities, setting up the project’s communication- Preparation of the first mobility for young people: the visit to Bucharest, at Small Academy hub- Preparation of the intellectual outputs: delivering 3 intellectual outputs, used in class with the youth attending the program:- Preparation of the mentorship program- Launching a communication campaign about the second mobility activity - Preparation of the second mobility for young people\"', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 160596.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::fe486497542fe0781d408c660259581a', 'code': '2021-1-ES01-KA220-HED-000027551', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'European network in D-flexible teaching', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'Development of training courses; Digital content, technologies and practices; New learning and teaching methods and approaches', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': \"&lt;&lt; Background &gt;&gt;The crisis caused by COVID-19 has imposed, on the one hand, social isolation in different degrees depending on the evolution of the pandemic and, on the other hand, the adaptation of the universities' education system and learning processes to a digital model. On the one hand, social isolation has caused the disappearance of inter-university networks which under normal circumstances would have been strongly cohesive. The aim of this project is to re-establish the university network that allows the strengthening of connections between European universities, focusing on the teaching staff as intra- and inter-university anchors which facilitate the constitution of a knowledge transfer network related to good digital and flexible teaching practices. On the other hand, serious deficiencies have been observed while adapting the education system to the situational needs that have been demanded by a digital and/or blended model. Sixty percent of universities claim to have adapted their systems to a digital model, but few had the capacity to respond fully to the crisis (Multirank, 2020). One of the mistakes committed during the pandemic because of the urgency of the situation was to make decisions without a clear idea about what type of distance or blended learning model to implement. This led to the launch of stopgap measures and adjustments. In many cases, attempts were made to replicate the in-person model, onboarding digital environments but without any stable or consistent pedagogical design. It is unsurprising that, given the situation, institutions were caught short in providing a coherent and stable response. One of the reasons for this difficulty has been the lack of teachers digital training in flexible digital methodologies and pedagogies that might respond to these new needs. The project will provide an answer to a common need detected across all the partner countries, i.e., the introduction of a learning programme specialising in online teaching methods that teachers can implement and adapt to their subjects and students. It will introduce innovative resources, tools and methodologies for a quality digital university education. Why focus on teachers? Because we believe that the relationships established among university teachers act as weak ties (connections between acquaintances) that are the best source for acquiring new information. They are much more effective than if we rely only on strong ties which are formed by closer connections, with a greater degree of overlapping between members and, therefore, less likely to provide different information. Weak ties are fundamental for the growth and existence of groups. They constitute essential links for disseminating information, managing groups and building relationships. The project will provide a database of teachers with common interests (training in digital pedagogies) to the EPALE platform (community of practice and collaborative space), which will be configured as a communication tool and collaborative workspace in the construction of new quality pedagogical practices. This process will be complemented by digital networking and the expansion of the already initiated ReCoIn-TaD network (https://bit.ly/3g5FPiJ).In short, the training of academics in innovative flexible pedagogies (Connected, Collaborative and Investigation, Active and Flipped) and in the creation of accessible and inclusive contents, through a methodology based on microlearning (microlessons and NOOC, NANO Open, Massive and Online Course) will facilitate the constitution of a network for the transfer and exchange of good practices capable of responding to different scenarios depending on the circumstances that may arise.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;The main objective of the project is the digital training of academics in digital pedagogies, and the involvement of this community in building distributed but cohesive network of cooperation for the exchange of good practices and digital transformation:The specific objectives are:Objective 1: Reinforce the design and outreach of flexible teaching practices that harness the resilience of university institutions to different pedagogical scenarios and facilitate educational access to disadvantaged groups.Objective 2: Provide online training to lecturers on flexible digital teaching practices (connected, collaborative and research, active and invested) and the creation of accessible and inclusive content. To do so, we will harness a methodology based on microlearning (microlessons and Nano Open Online Courses) and on a critical, social, and network pedagogical model.Objective 3: Cement a model of European inter-university cooperation by creating a cohesive and distributed university network where teachers are posited as intermediary connection nodes (anchors) within and between universities for the exchange of practices in flexible digital teaching methods. Objective 4. Generate added value for the Erasmus+ programme by offering an online training programme in innovative digital methodologies that is multilingual (Spanish, French, English, Italian and Portuguese) and based on microlearning techniques (NOOCs). This will shore up lifelong learning and the recognition of official credits, and facilitate educational access to disadvantaged groups.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;Project execution will be collaborative and all partners. Alignment between partners is expected and the project objectives will be achieved in a collaborative manner. The different supported activities are inter-related and will in some cases be developed in parallel and in others be the basis for implementing the next ones. The project will develop six activities: Activity 1: Pedagogical design and preparation of the training programme. Led by Savoir*Devenir (France). The entire consortium will partner on specifying methodological, contents, objectives, technological resources, .... This activity will result in the plan training programme on digital skills (R1). This activity is the basis for the further development of the NOOCs (R2) and the guide to good practices (R3).Activity 2: Content development, digitisation, integration and production of the OERs. Led by the MAG Uninettuno, MAG S.R.LMAG will lead the coordination of this phase in which the OERs will be developed. The remaining partners will collaborate on development according to the technical instructions from the MAG. These will be interactive and accessible resources (virtual reality, augmented reality and/or simulations) with open and multilingual access (Spanish, French, English, Italian and Portuguese). Each NOOCs will have several OER: 5 interactive and 5 descriptive OERs. MAG S.R.L will be responsible for developing and updating the consortium’s responsive open website (https://recointad.com/). Activity 3: Content development, digitisation and NOOC integration and production. Led by UNED.The content of the different NOOCs will be digitised and integrated onto the OPENMOOC platform (Led by ECO Digital Learning) in line with the training programme. This work will be tasked to the ECO Digital Learning startup. Each NOOC will be developed in a different language and a different partner will be responsible for it: Spanish (UNED) French (Savoir*Devenir), English (Burgas Free University), Italian (Università degli Studi di Catania) and Portuguese (UAb). Each partner will also be responsible for a different NOOC and spearhead its development: 1 (S*D), 2 (UNICT), 3 (UAb), 4 (BFE) and 5 (UNED)Activity 4: Microlearning Programme Implementation. Led by UNED with the aim of delivering on project objectives 1 and 2. Each partner will also be responsible for a different NOOC. The training plan will be developed online through the OPENMOOC platform (Led by ECO Digital Learning).Activity 5: Microlearning programme evaluation to be led by UAb (Portugal), which will carry out the design and development of the course validation plan. This activity will include the integration of all partners.  Activity 6: Creation of a network of inter-university cooperation to generate flexible and innovative practices, will be carried out. It will be led by UNED. This activity is cross-cutting throughout the project and related to integration with project management activities. The project will respond to a common need detected in all partner countries of the partnership and is the introduction of a training program specialized in digital pedagogies aimed at training teachers in its implementation and adaptation to their subjects and students. The project will introduce innovative resources, tools and methodologies for a quality digital university education. In addition, the project will generate a distributed transnational network that will strengthen a European interuniversity cooperation model, where teachers are configured as intra- and interuniversity connection nodes that will progressively increase throughout the life of the project and beyond.The open and free nature of the project results, as well as the distributed nature of the network, guarantee the sustainability of the project.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;The tangible results are the intellectual efforts that come together to achieve the main objective of digital training in flexible pedagogies and in the creation of the cooperation network between academics. These outcomes are: R1. Training Programme on digital skills in Flexible and Innovative Methodologies: A microlearning programme in digital training in flexible and innovative pedagogies, which will consist of five multilingual NOOC (NANO Open, Massive and Online Course) (English, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish).R2. NOOCs (NANO Open, Massive and Online Courses) in flexible methodologies: 1. Connected and critical; 2. Collaborative and research; 3. Active and gamified; 4. Inverted or Flipped; 5. Design of flexible learning digital programs R3. Guide to good practices in flexible digital pedagogies. Based on the objective results, a guide to good practices in flexible digital pedagogics will be developed.R4. European network in D-flexible teaching: The main project goal is to develop an international distributed network of cooperation where teachers are configured as nodes that make inter- and intra-university connections possible and the dissemination of good, digital and innovative teaching practices.R5. Effectiveness research of microlearning based on NOOC which allows to advance a new way of learning through microlessons and in open environments. It will make it possible to reinforce new teaching methods on the basis of reliable scientific results.The main intangible result is the generation of added value to the Erasmus + programme through the offer of this digital training programme. Participating academics will have improved their ability to work in teams, to organiza themselves autonomously and to solve day-to-day problems of the teaching practice.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 309565.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::5edf8578e0248b7aa01ef5c0ea0d6585', 'code': '2019-1-BG01-KA204-062331', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Immersive Learning in Information Security', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'Open and distance learning; ICT - new technologies - digital competences; New innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The project MISSILE is focused on extremely hot topic, developing key competencies, related to awareness about the information security vulnerabilities, threats and countermeasures. The main goal of the project is to develop a methodology for raising awareness of the information security vulnerabilities, threats and security solutions through learning and training and therefore increase overall security level of users and organizations. It can be achieved by the following objectives: - to define user needs and requirements in the field of the information security training; - to develop a concept for information security training, covering the major issues regarding the contemporary information security issues; - to develop platform, which represents an actual implementation and actualizes the created methodology in a feasible and reliable way; - to create learning materials, related to information security issues, social engineering, users’ beliefs and understandings about sensitive data and information security, as well as selecting and applying properly defined security policies, mechanisms and countermeasures; - to conduct effective valorisation of the created concept and its realization by conducting of piloting with a selected target group of users.By basing our solution into iterative working platform and user trials, we will push our system into piloting for testing and evaluating the created methodology.

Although using FC methods has multiple benefits and is growing popularity, researchers and practitioners indicate that among impediments of widespread usage of FC methods are the additional time and technological support in relation to development of flipped learning activities. The flipped approach often involves the investment of significant time and energy on the part of instructors (e.g., recording video lectures; designing additional in-class activities). It is therefore recommended for teachers flipping their courses in team. By working in team, teachers can share their experiences of implementing flipped classrooms as well as their teaching resourcesThe “Developing Flipped Methods for Teaching” project aims at developing all the necessary flipped learning pedagogical material (out-of-class tasks, pre-assessment tools, in-class activities) for teaching a discipline (psychology) covering a whole academic year course. The project aims at overcoming the difficulties of elaborating multiple materials for teaching with flipped classroom design. By collaboration of six education institutions an entire discipline will be covered with FC materials in seven languages (English, Romanian, Hungarian, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Slovak and Greek), tackling a gap between educational research and practice. One of the project partners, The Mihai Eminescu National Pedagogical High School (Romania) is a secondary-level educational institute. Due to the particularities of the Romanian education system they offer teacher and kindergarten teacher training program, whereby graduates receive a teacher-kindergarten teacher degree.  In Romania psychology is part of the secondary-level school curricula, so high schools can also benefit from educational materials translated to Romanian. Their main role  in the project is to translate the developed educational methods by the higher education institutes  from the partnership, to test and adapt it to the Romanian requirements. The partnership is composed from other six Higher Education Institutes with Teacher Training Faculties, who have important experience as partners or leaders Strategic Partnership projects and educational innovation. The main intellectual output of the project are the pedagogical materials for teaching an entire course of psychology with flipped classroom (FC) methods (materials for 30 courses), available in seven languages. Each pedagogical material is composed of instructional video, out-of-class work plans (online activities)   associated with Low-stakes, formative assignments  as well as  in-class activities and assessment tools. A questionnaire for surveying data regarding using FC methods in teaching social sciences will also be developed. Survey results will reveal the FC methods and sources used by teachers and academic staff from six partner countries. Results can be used as sources for developing pedagogical materials. Moreover, by publishing the results a source of inspiration will be available for teachers and policymakers for introducing flipped methods in the teaching practice. Teachers from higher and secondary education institutes will have all the necessary materials for teaching the subject of psychology with flipped classroom methodology. Project results are expected to facilitate the use of FC practices in teaching psychology. Studies indicate that when changing traditional methods to flipped classroom student’s performance and satisfaction will improve. FC methods increase student’s motivation and their self-confidence, their commitment to learn.

Characteristic of any ethnic group, its foods were also a product of its folklore and religious traditions. In modern times, as links between different nationalities become more accessible, there is a serious \"\"modernization\"\" of traditional cuisine. Through the internet, the cuisine of the peoples from all over the world is accessible by anyone, whether resident in a small village or in a city. The phenomenon of unification of the kitchen and commercialization of holidays (when it is mainly the preparation of traditional ritual food) is increasingly occurring. EuRiCa  Project strives to contribute and foster the preservation of the ritual cuisine, its ethnocultural traits, as well as the folklore and traditions connected with it via the development of a methodology for digitization and creation of digital representations of ritual recipes which to be integrated into the virtual culture space of Europe and thus to be accessible globally. The digitalization of ritual recipes and the creation of their appropriate virtual representations increases the need for appropriate methods and IT solutions that support access to these little-known ethnographic objects, as well as providing the means to make them popular. As the culture sector evolves and changes, so do the skills required of individuals active in the sector who are specialists in areas, which require high-levels of knowledge but most often they are not directly connected to the IT sector.

The first is referred to as (independent) entrepreneurship, the latter as corporate entrepreneurship. Many initiatives exist that are fostering entrepreneurship, while corporate entrepreneurship (and intrapreneurship) is still not the focus of most programme initiatives.  Corporate entrepreneurship is defined as a process that goes on inside an existing firm and that may lead to new business ventures, the development of new products, services or processes and the renewal of strategies and competitive postures. As such, it can be seen as the sum of a company’s innovation, venturing and renewal efforts. Corporate entrepreneurship would not work, unless there are entrepreneurially-thinking employees – so called intrapreneurs.  Although intrapreneurship (maybe because the entrepreneurship definition of the European Union is very broad) is not directly mentioned in the Europe 2020 strategy, its important features – innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship – are part of the strategy paper of the role of education and training in the implementation of Europe 2020. CIP (Competiveness and Innovation Programme 2007 – 2013) and COSME (Programme for the Competiveness of enterprises and SMEs 2014-2020) also deal with the issue of entrepreneurial thinking, innovation and creativity – also within existing companies. Hence, corporate entrepreneurship,  is and will be an important growth factor for European economies as well as a main focus of the European policy to stay competitive in the world economy. Innovation (also determined by corporate entrepreneurship) is one of the driving forces of competitiveness and subsequently for company growth. Observing innovativeness in Europe, figures show that regarding product and process innovation medium-sized enterprises are performing significantly lower than large companies in almost every European country (Eurostat 2011).  Still, European countries are ranked high in innovativeness reports (e.g. Global Innovativness Index, 2015), but other world regions (such as South East Asia and Latin America) are catching up. Others are already overtaking Europe.  A holistic approach of the SCOPE project will assure that companies and their employees can benefit from the project and intrapreneurship can be established more efficiently. Newly developed and innovative competence matrices for managers and for employees/students and an easy-to-use ex-ante gap analysis tool for managers will offer added value to the European company and training provider landscape. Additionally the development of standardized employee incentive models for companies fostering intrapreneurship, which will be developed within the project, are missing in the European Education landscape.

The expected results of the project focus on achieving the objectives of Priority 7 of the Smart Specialization Strategy (Latvia) or RIS3: identification of the existing resources of territories and their specialization, proposing prospective economic development opportunities and directions, int. al. leading and prospective business directions in the municipal territories. According to the NACE Rev. 2 classification of economic activities, it corresponds to Section J: Information and communication. The aim of the project is to examine barriers to communication competencies between mentors and mentees and propose solutions how to enhance and maintain the business mentor network by means of communication technologies. The project is interdisciplinary because, according to the OECD classification, it directly relates to such fields of science as economics, entrepreneurship, communication as well as information technology. The project involves the following research studies: a technical and economic feasibility study and an industry research study. Project activities: Technical and economic feasibility study on the communication competencies model for the business mentor network; Theoretical literature studies, an examination and comparison of mentor work specifics in Latvia and abroad; Interviews with business mentor network participants (mentors and mentees); Interviews, questionnaire with experts; Mobility, experience exchange with foreign countries; Development of a smart communication competencies model for the business mentor network; Development of an effective communication and collaboration methodology for the business mentor network; A pilot group of mentors and mentees for assessing the effective communication methodology; Creating mentoring handbook; Publishing original scientific articles in journals or conference proceedings included in Web of Science or SCOPUS (or other) databases Development of a joint monograph; Development of network between partners.In order that a mentor can act, communication is necessary, which is key to successful entrepreneurship. Regardless of whether communication is internal or external, horizontal or vertical, all the forms of communication in the entrepreneurial environment help to increase efficiency and improve organizational performance. The key purpose of communication is to ensure that a message is comprehended in a way it was initially intended in order to reach the audience. That is why communication could be both verbal and visual – it is a continuous process, during which interaction occurs among the communicator, the channel, the message and the communicates. An essential element in communication is the communicative effect or response, which indicates whether the message has reached the audience and whether the communication objective is going to be achieved.The target group represents several fields: Research and academic environment: scientists, students, academic personnel in social sciences, as well employees engaged in research; Entrepreneur environment: entrepreneurs from all countries, who wish to participate in business mentor network activities as mentors and mentees; enterprise stakeholders – employees, customers, business partners; entrepreneurs as users of the communication methodology for the business mentor network; Society: the society as a whole, as entrepreneurship in a region affects every resident through creating new jobs, improving the economic situation in the region, which increases the purchasing power of residents, amounts of taxes paid to the local and national governments.Methodology and division of work will be symmetrical, where similar activities for development of intellectual output is going to be implemented in parallel in the participating countries.  More in detail, the expected impact on the participant organizations is: more than 20 staff persons will be involved in the project; employing research staff; improving competence in communication field; enhancing international relationships; further collaboration in research.Project will apply competence-based approach and assess their quality, impact and relevance. This can contribute to higher quality of education and training and support permeability between the different education and training pathways.The expected results of the project would therefore be effective solutions to developing the business mentor network in all countries:performed  study on a communication competencies model; designed a smart communication competencies  model and a methodology; developed mentoring handbook;  original scientific articles published in journals or conference proceedings.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 142516.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::c3a7a91c46c2b8e68bb4a034f2cb8e13', 'code': '2017-1-IT02-KA204-036745', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Tacit knowledge emerging for a sustainable valorisation of the cultural heritage in rural and peripheral communities', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'Rural development and urbanisation; Recognition (non-formal and informal learning/credits); Intercultural/intergenerational education and (lifelong)learning', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Over many years the teams of volunteers who organise and manage the local cultural festivals and events have built up vast reservoirs of knowledge that is invaluable to their communities. While much of this knowledge is explicit and easily transmitted a significant proportion of it is tacit, based on know-how. Tacit knowledge is impossible to transmit through central media but it can be transmitted by lateral media. Social media are excellent lateral media tools and can easily be designed to support the codification of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. This can greatly facilitate knowledge transfer. Preventing any loss of knowledge within the communities in question and safeguarding tacit knowledge for all communities is a key priority for partners that this project will address.Based on the knowledge elements identified as critical by the senior volunteers to the role of cultural festival or event manager, partners have defined a bespoke curriculum framework complete with all required learning outcomes.Partners developed an intergenerational mentoring programme to encourage the development of the next generation of cultural festival and event managers. They designed a mentor training programme for older volunteers and an induction to mentoring for potential mentees. Subsequently partners have organised and managed a range of volunteer shadowing opportunities during the local events and festivals.The validation of prior learning was another turning point of VAL.oR project, facing the practical difficulties still present for the full application of this citizens’ right.Beyond the EU guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning produced by Cedefop in 2009, we developed national/regional Step-by-Step Guides, with the possibility to make just an exercise in style, because by now this procedure seems to be still far for its full application in all countries involved.VAL.oR envisages 3 specific primary target groups (a) adult education staff and management especially those interested in the validation of non-formal and informal learning; (b) senior volunteers who are members of local cultural festival and event management committees; (c) next generation volunteers who support the running of local cultural festivals and events.The partnership is composed by a VET centre, an AE public centre and a national association engaged in the safeguard of cultural and natural heritage in IT, in BG one HE institution, in RO an AE association, in IE a county body and an enterprise expert in multimedia, in FI an IT company, and in PT one Municipality.The work programme comprised:(1) A research and needs analysis process to identify the learning outcomes for the curriculum, accreditation of prior learning models, tacit knowledge management models(2) The design, development and testing of the bespoke induction to pedagogy training for senior volunteers(3) The design, development and testing of the new accredited cultural festival and event manager curriculum(4) The development of the step-by-step guide to support the accreditation of prior learning for the senior volunteers, and not only(5) The design, development and testing of the on-line tacit knowledge codification tools(6) The design, development and testing of the on-line observatory of local cultural festivals and events(7) The new induction to pedagogy training will comprise approximately 30 hours of learning for seniors and the curriculum for youngsters will comprise 150 hours of study (40h. face-to-face and 110h. on-line self-study).(8) Validating project outputs with all target groups was one of the key activities where partners invested time and resources in throughout the project life-cycle.Pilots were run in 5 countries: Bulgaria, Ireland, Romania, Portugal and Italy (Abruzzo and Lazio), cooperating with the established local working groups throughout the project life-cycle. VAL.oR proposes a new approach to sustaining local and regional cultural heritage and the economic benefits that accrue to communities from well managed and organised festivals and events. The new pedagogic resources and on-line environments developed will be inexpensive to use; will require little in terms of on-going investment to maintain; and the course-ware developed are available as an OER to all interested training providers or service providers. For all partners, both within the consortium and those institutional and community based partners who participate in the local working groups, the tools and resources developed are incorporated into their core service provision and form an integral part of service delivery into the future.The final IOs were diffused to an audience of more than 16,400 indirect users, including the 700 associations members of the silent partner, the Swiss Federation of Continuing Training.

Only a few EU Universities are already ready for good quality distance learning, with tools for course management, including live sessions, interactive teaching and collaborative activities. The most of EU Universities had to cope with the emergency situation that called for a quick organizational and cultural rearrangement and a change of strategies, that perhaps represented the most difficult step for teachers and students.Digital technologies are becoming very relevant at the EU level for teachers and students. However, the current limitations on the movement of people and teaching hours may restrict this type of delivering. For this reason, EDU-GATE project will provide a detailed European multi-sectoral analysis indicating the comparison of current situation of teaching digitalization (As-Is and To-Be analysis), together a transversal needs' analysis. These in-depth multi-countries researches will be carried out for the determination of innovative approaches and concrete supporting tools for post-graduated and master learning needs for educational institutions.A detailed analysis of digital educational requirements will be also produced, providing cutting-edge tools to foster innovation and value creation in educational activities and academic communities building. After the already done preliminary academic Partners needs' analyses, a common study will be carried out for determination of new requirements, determining new key and transversal competences, reflecting them to concrete and open resilient educational programs, and sharing at European level effective tools in an integrated platform infrastructure.Four intellectual outputs will be delivered:O1) Impact and diffusion of digital education in Higher Education Institutions: a research on innovative solutions, methods, skills and best practices to enhance the EU Digital Education Action Plan;O2) Online training curriculum to identify a learning contents, experiential knowledge and skills assessment tools: methodology of development and delivering; O3) Integrated online platform for digital integrated learning, multi-level cooperation and resources sharing; O4) Learning contents, classroom guidelines and skills assessment tools.Also an innovative curriculum, including the most advanced educational design and delivering techniques, will be created for the development of teachers' skills and a certificate of attendance will be released to participants. This also thanks an advanced e-learning platform, integrated in EDU-GATE website, that will be designed by the 7 involved expert organizations (LUISS Guido Carli University, University of Macedonia, Burgas Free University, Rigas Tehniska Universitate, European Center for Quality, Symplexis and Linfa Digital). Almost 12 innovative multimedia e-modules will be prepared, permitting effective learning activities and the sharing of best practices. It will gain the necessary knowledge to give the possibility to teachers and students to increase their competences and give more opportunities, inclusion and effectiveness, by the digitalization of learning flows, innovative learning tools and new procedural applications in educational institutions. Specific events with institutions, educational associations, public and private teaching organizations will be held for this purpose. Concretely the participants from each country will attend the multimedia online EDU-GATE modules and then they will have the chance to verify their digital learning skills and knowledge by the available e-tests.

To pursue this goal, the Open Innovation paradigm is adopted, and the Quadruple Helix model is applied: while focusing on Higher Education learners and adults in lifelong learning as key change-makers in short and mid-term, the Δ-project looks at government and business representatives as key players for long-lasting improvement at system level. The last project output, the Policy Paper, will provide educational stakeholders with practical guidance for adopting, adapting and further developing the Δ-programmes, in the (true) belief that providing people with the ability of thinking critically is a strong and longlasting form of empowerment, and empowering people means to empower the whole society.\"', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 277941.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::8c47c62def554783316570bab80cd5ed', 'code': '2020-1-TR01-KA226-HE-098258', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Redesigning Introductory Computer Programming Using Innovative Online Modules', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'New innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses; ICT - new technologies - digital competences; Pedagogy and didactics', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': \"Background and Project GoalThe Covid-19 Pandemic enforced the education system to change radically. Almost all universities worldwide were suddenly forced to shift all their education to virtual learning in response to the pandemic. Support for lecturers' professional development is crucial, and course design is even more critical than in traditional education settings. Online teaching brings major challenges to faculty members. And one of the most significant is the numerous complexities involved in moving a face-to-face course into the online platforms. On the other hand, research shows that 91% of the university’s lecturers were unwilling to teach online.Many academic institutions that are reluctant to change their traditional pedagogical approach have no choice but to move entirely to online teaching-learning. But since the traditional education system mostly prevails in many European countries, teachers and students in online education have problems, especially for engineering departments, due to dense curriculum on hand-zone and practical lessons. Other problems center around the experience in online teaching/learning, students' collaboration, lack of support from lecturers, the complexity of materials provided, and inappropriate homework environment. These facts reduce satisfaction and enthusiasm for both students and educators. Therefore, compliance with online lectures with existing curricula related to engineering studies is highly necessary.Our effort focuses on Computer Programming and Algorithms lecture that is a core element for all engineering disciplines in this project. Computer Programming and Algorithms is a complicated course to teach and learn. It is now even more difficult on online platforms. Today, Industry 4.0 and 5.0 topics are emerging fields and have rising demand during the pandemic period. The increasing interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications is closely related to them. Under current circumstances, online Computer Programming and Algorithms courses must be addressed with innovative solutions to support this level with well-educated professionals. In this project, teachers will be trained to overcome online education challenges while preparing adequate course material suits to common “Computer Programming and Algorithms” lectures. In this way, we design appropriate online teaching methods for this lecture and integrate them with online technologies to improve students' learning motivation and interest, maintain students' concentration, and enhance students' learning.Objectives are Planned to be Achieved within the Scope of the Project:Our objective here is to develop a well-structured online teaching method for computer programming and algorithms related courses. For this purpose, educators will get trained on online education pedagogies and didactics to face challenges with the lack of student satisfaction. Adaptation of online pedagogy and educational materials for this course will be one that emphasizes student-centered learning and employs active learning activities. This new course materials will be able to implement for both online &amp; hybrid educational systems.In particular, the project aims at persuading educators to amalgamate immersive technologies in online educational programs while developing their pedagogical knowledge to boost student’s willingness to moreover involvement. Expected Outputs upon the Project Completion:1. Improving lecturers’ role with required knowledge, skills, teaching methods, and techniques to deliver efficient online classes2. Effective pedagogical practices for online teaching perception of experienced instructors.3. Formulating sustainable curriculum implementation for both hybrid and online education4. Integrating new online course materials with gamification techniques to the “Computer Programming and Algorithms” curriculum helps students attend online.5. Developing synchronous and asynchronous methodologies to deliver online “Computer Programming and Algorithms” courses effectively.6. Developing offline video content for students who have limited internet connections. 7. Developing course materials with a new curriculum to deliver better online “Computer Programming and Algorithms” lessons.Project Main Activities1- Intellectual Outputs- Guidebook: Online/Hybrid Teaching Practices for Effective Programming Classes- Curriculum Development for Online/Hybrid Computer Programming and Algorithm- Web-platform and Mobile App for Programming Courses- Gamified Interactive Video Tutorials- Gamified E-Quizzes and Case Studies2.

However, research on green entrepreneurs to date has focused on individual green entrepreneurs, neglecting wider economic and social contexts within which they operate. In addition, the green entrepreneurship movement is often presented as a non-profit motivated business sector that belongs to the ‘social entrepreneurship stable’. While the emerging green megatrend has brought green entrepreneurship into sharp focus, it is still seen and regarded by many as an add-on to the market economy comprising business ventures that address and satiate the consumer habits of environmentalists and green activists.Entrepreneurs are frequently thought of as national assets to be cultivated, motivated, and remunerated to the greatest possible extent. Great entrepreneurs can change the way we live and work. If successful, their innovations can improve standards of living, create wealth and jobs and contribute to a growing economy. The European Commission first referred to the importance of entrepreneurship education in 2003, in the European Green Paper on Entrepreneurship in Europe. By 2006, the European Commission had identified a ‘sense of initiative and entrepreneurship’ as one of the eight key competences necessary for all members of a knowledge-based society. The 2008 Small Business Act for Europe, the 2012 Communication on Rethinking Education, the 2013 Entrepreneurship Action Plan 2020, and more recently the New Skills Agenda for Europe, have kept the need to promote entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial learning under the spotlight.Realising the pivotal role that education plays in the development of entrepreneurship the EntreComp framework was developed by the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission’s in-house science service. It aims to provide evidence-based scientific support to the European policy-making process. EntreComp was developed to become a reference de facto for any initiative aiming to foster entrepreneurial capacity of European citizens. It consists of 3 interrelated and interconnected competence areas: ‘Ideas and opportunities’, ‘Resources’ and ‘Into action’. Each of the areas is made up of 5 competences, which, together, constitute the building blocks of entrepreneurship as a competence.Consortium partners are of the opinion that the EntreComp framework needs to be reconsidered; it needs to incorporate and reflect the green objectives of our time. It is not sufficient to have some green entrepreneurs; rather every entrepreneur needs to incorporate environmental and ecological factors into their business from the very beginning. While greening existing businesses will be a long and arduous task most likely influenced by carbon taxation and other policy measures, the emphasis for Vocational Education and Training should be firmly placed on greening the entrepreneurship actions of next generation entrepreneurs. Greening EntreComp, as the key benchmark for entrepreneurship education is now an essential first step.Intellectual OutputsIO1 - Green EntreComp Framework - The following groups of partners will work in teams to green the different areas of the EntreComp Framework as follows: Ideas &amp; Opportunities will be led by UPB with support from SRC and UoP; Resources will be led by UPIT with support from CALLIDUS and ISQ; Into Action will be led by CARDET with support from BFU and BFI Burgenland. These groups of partners will revise and re-draft the 3 competence areas and the 15 key competences to reflect essential sustainable entrepreneurship values and replace or revise the associated learning outcomes for each competence.IO2 -  Business Modelling for Circular Economy Businesses - The following groups of partners will develop a suite of business modelling training resources that address each of the following recognized circular economy business models: SRC will lead The Co-creation of Products/Services Model supported by BFI Burgenland and UPIT; CALLIDUS will lead the The Sustainable Consumption Model supported by UoP and CARDET; and BFU will lead the The Collaborative Recycling/Reuse Model supported by UPB and ISQ.

For students, this is vital as it affects their success after graduation, especially for non economics and business disciplines, where the students are very well taught on the disciplines material but most of the times they lack the development of all those competences that will help them act upon what they have learned during their degree and use their knowledge to create value. That is what the INSPIRE  training material comes to cover.INSPIRE focuses on the development of entrepreneurial thinking to drive discovery, creativity and innovation primarily for HE students but also for VET and aims to train 120 HE and VET students that will be eligible for certification, according to the standards of 17024, as well as recognition of their knowledge, via ECTS.INSPIRE is based on the EntreComp framework that has been published by the JRC, on behalf of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, and has developed a definition of entrepreneurship as a competence &amp; a reference framework describing it, the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (EntreComp). By producing a common definition of what entrepreneurship as a competence is, the EntreComp aims to foster entrepreneurial learning.INSPIRE seeks to develop HE and VET students based on the EntreComp framework, through the application of a systematic methodology using student centered innovative approaches and also to validate the competences that the VET and HE students develop via the development of a Certification Scheme, according to ISO requirements, and the assignment of ECTS points for HE students.The general objectives of the project are to:•Foster entrepreneurial  thinking to drive discovery, creativity and innovation in HE and VET students.•Develop a personilised pathway for students in order to help them develop those competences that identify with their own training needs•Develop a Training Needs Analysis tool and a curricula for the innovative, entrepreneurial student•Develop Training material/ Classroom, PBL that corresponds to those LO’s and has been proven to promote innovation and discovery. •Train at least 120 HE and VET students that will have the chance to validate their knowledge.•Validate the acquired knowledge via the development of a certification scheme and the awarding of ECTS points.•Development and promotion of a Multilingual Online open e-learning/networking spaceThe Outputs of the project will be:O1.

However, mobile traffic is still growing at an unprecedented rate and the need for more sophisticated broadband services is still further pushing the limits on current standards to provide even tighter integration between wireless technologies and higher speeds. The increase in number of mobile devices and traffic, the change in the nature of service and device, along with the pressure on operation and capital costs, and energy efficiency are all continuously putting stringent limits on the requirement of the design of mobile networks.

Thus far, U-space efforts have focused on developing a set of baseline services (i.e., U1 and U2 capabilities enabling services such as identification, flight planning, and tracking). When deployed, these services will enable low traffic density applications such as agricultural surveillance and infrastructure inspection. Urban, high-density operations, however, will require a different approach, and a degree of autonomy that does not yet exist in current-day air traffic management. First, in order to sustain high traffic demands, the urban airspace must be able to allow a shared use of airspace, rather than the approach used today of exclusively assigning parts of the airspace to individual flights. Secondly, at the expected extremely high traffic densities, airspace design, flight planning, and separation management become increasingly interdependent. With the traffic densities that are considered for urban applications these interdependencies necessitate a unified approach to all aspects of traffic management that determine how vehicles interact with each other. This project will develop a unified approach to airspace rules on the one hand, and flight planning and separation management approaches on the other hand. It will build upon the results of the current U-space projects, the first Metropolis project, and established separation algorithms.

Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) has shown potential regressing various cancer types in the laboratory setting. Owing to their properties, CAP is a unique source of high concentrations of reactive radicals, electrons, ions, UV etc. that may induce various effects in living tissue. CAP has shown selectivity in where cancer cells are treated with minimal effect to healthy ones; this renders plasma suitable to treat carcinomas in very sensitive areas or organs where an unmet need to minimise damage/side-effects exists. CAP can be delivered through dielectric tubes of variable length, which makes it ideal for minimally invasive and precise laparoscopic and endoscopic operations.

While several research activities have been conducted over the past 5 years on this topic, wider industrial adoption is lagging due to the following restrictions:\\n\\tLimited cognition and intelligence\\n\\tLow performance of collaborative operations\\n\\tCollaboration fluidity is rather low as the operators have to adapt to the particularities of the robots.\\n\\tComplexity in robot programming which requires the involvement of skilled engineers, does not provide flexibility in the execution phase, and does not benefit from the tacit knowledge of experienced operators.\\n\\nThus, despite the fact the mechatronics are quite advanced, a perfect matching of mechanics and control is required to create robots that advance from repetitive and precision-oriented tasks to becoming intelligent and helpful co-workers. Proper human robot interaction is the most important ground to be covered. \\n\\nThus, JARVIS aims to develop a reusable set of tools that enable AI driven multimodal means of interaction: a) involving interfaces for physical and remote information exchange, robot control and programming, b) providing social skills to a variety of robots to achieve seamless user-centric interaction that extends human ability for complex tasks and c) demonstrating scalability of application and ability to achieve economies at scale.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 10338200.0, 'fundedAmount': 9319270.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::64a990f03069d9b7981ed6fb71089589', 'code': '101096146', 'acronym': 'FIDAL', 'title': 'Field Trials beyond 5G', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2023-01-01', 'endDate': '2025-12-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-JU-SNS-2022', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['SNS Large Scale Trials and Pilots (LST&Ps) with Verticals'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Long-term towards Evolved 5G and 6G research needs mobilization of massive volumes of ideas, from which the best can emerge and be taken into standardization.

In brief, the PEM electrolyzer can operate at high current densities (several amperes pr. cm2) due to the low internal resitstance of a thin acidic ion conducting membrane (an ion-exchange membrane). The main drawback is that the acidic system demands noble metal catalysts on both electrodes and expensive noble metal coatings on the bipolar plates and electrode backing.  The alkaline electrolyzer, does not rely on noble metals for neither catalysts nor bipolar plates, but it suffers from higher internal resistance because it does not have a thin ion conducting membrane. Despite many years of research, no research groups or companies have been able to develop a satisfactory ion-exchange membrane for the alkaline system. All attempts suffer from sigificantly lower conductivity and poor stability. The alkaline electrolyzer have so far been left with thick porous diaphragms with a significantly higher area-specific resistance, which practically limits the current density to a fraction of an ampere pr. cm2.  In the proposed project, an alkaline electroyzer will be developed around a new membrane concept. The membrane is an ion-solvating membrane. It is a polymer, which dissolves the electrolyte of the electrolyzer (aqueous potasium hydroxide). Like an ion-exchange membrane it is nonporous and it can therefore, in contrast to a porous diaphragm, be as thin as an ion exchange membrane.

Digital methodologies are exploited and developed to realise an innovative carbon-neutral construction system implementing structural geometries that are compression dominant, optimise the CO2 sequestration capability and make use of demountable discrete blocks combined with system redundancy. The latter will be assisted by the combined use of funicular shapes and post-tensioning with shape memory alloys. To handle the complex geometries in combination with a carbon-negative concrete-like material, an innovative digital pipeline is developed that incorporates for example computed tomography, topology optimization and 3D construction. Using CO2 sequestration to harden the concrete-like material for widely used load bearing structures will reduce embodied greenhouse gas emissions in an unprecedented way. The material design, incorporating recycled materials and by-products derived from other industrial processes (e.g. slags  and ashes) will equally reduce raw material usage. The intrinsic durability properties by introducing a system that is not susceptible to rebar corrosion and is deconstructable, will achieve both long service life and circularity, to further reduce the environmental impact of the built environment. The overall superiority of the proposed system with respect to the current state of practice will be demonstrated through a full life cycle analysis.

Therapeutic targeting is hampered by the complexity of the disease, which includes not only molecular changes within the tumor cell itself, but also within its microenvironment. Tumor angiogenesis, tumor-stroma interactions, interactions with immune cells, with the extracellular matrix and cancer stem cell niches allow for malignant cell survival and promote metastasis, the leading cause for cancer-associated mortality. Proteoglycans (PGs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) – structurally diverse carbohydrates of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces - have emerged as novel biomarkers and molecular players both within tumor cells and their microenvironment, as they integrate signals from growth factors, chemokines and integrins, and cell-cell as well as matrix adhesion. Importantly, their expression is dysregulated in numerous tumor entities, and has been shown to modulate each of the hallmarks of cancer as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg (Cell 2011). We hypothesize that dysregulated function of PGs and GAGs simultaneously affects all molecular steps towards cancer metastasis as a general principle applicable to multiple tumor entities. Pharmacological modulation of their function thus emerges as an attractive multitargeted antitumoral approach which simultaneously acts at multiple levels of disease progression. Besides providing extensive knowledge transfer and training for researchers, the combined expertise of the GLYCANC consortium aims at performing a detailed structural analysis of PG and GAG glycans in disease using state-of-the art methodology, analysing their regulation via epigenetic mechanisms and microRNAs, and elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant PG and GAG function.

It requires on the one an in-depth understanding of Open Science (principles, application, benefits) as well as of the European AAT landscape as is. On the other it requires an application concept, i.e. convincing stakeholders of the added values and guiding them to integration of Open Science in their daily research work beyond single European projects.\\n\\n\\nFour objectives have been defined in order to achieve the goal of OSCAR:\\n\\nObjective 1 (WP2, WP3):\\nAn assessment of the development of Open Science in European AAT projects since the beginning of FP7, i.e. FP7 and Horizon 2020, considering also the AAT related JTIs Clean Sky and SESAR.

Each WP includes several projects, whose implementation is based on the strong interaction between all beneficiaries. The topics include: complex sediment transport processes involving sand-mud mixtures, mixed-size sands, and granular-fluid mixtures; coupling between hydrodynamics (waves, storm surges, and tides), sediment transport, and morphological changes; and engineering solutions to issues/problems related to erosion/sedimentation with emphasis on sustainability and resilience. The research methods include effective process-based engineering modeling, advanced numerical simulations, and innovative experiments.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 2618730.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_______::d98177da73cae05f27c37b989a2934e9', 'code': '212014', 'acronym': 'IMAC-PRO', 'title': 'Industrialization of Manufacturing Technologies for Composite Profiles for Aerospace Applications', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2008-07-01', 'endDate': '2012-12-31', 'callIdentifier': 'FP7-AAT-2007-RTD-1', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::f718a9348cc291bb0f0190495f29c037', 'code': '795175', 'acronym': 'NMRSIGN', 'title': 'NMR insights on the soluble Guanylyl Cyclase conformational dynamics to illuminate the SIGNaling pathway', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2018-08-01', 'endDate': '2020-07-31', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-MSCA-IF-2017', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Individual Fellowships'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Gas-sensing proteins play an important role in mediating biological events. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is activated when nitric oxide (NO) binds to heme Fe of sGC, and then stimulates cyclization of guanosine 5-triphosphate (GTP) to the second messenger cyclic guanosine 3,5-monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn has a direct role in the control of a variety of physiological processes in several signal transduction pathways. Disruptions in the NO/sGC/cGMP signalling pathway have been linked to a variety of diseases including congestive heart failure, stroke, hypertension and neurodegeneration. In this proposal, we will derive novel molecular insight into the heme-containing sensor domain of human sGC that is the primary receptor for NO and therefore plays a significant role in NO-signalling by employing structural and computational methods. The project will use the power of solution NMR spectroscopy and enhanced conformational sampling computational approaches to improve our atomistic understanding for this key biological protein and to identify a representative conformational ensemble that will be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries, so as to identify new, original, and more effective compounds for the activation of sGC. This novel approach of combining NMR and computational MD data to identify receptor conformations that play a major role in biomolecular recognition before commencing the structure-based virtual screening is expected to have a major impact in the field of drug design. Throughout this fellowship, the fellow will gain invaluable experience by combining the already accumulated experience in computational biology and CADD with advanced methods using NMR and computational data for the study of biomolecular structure and dynamics.

OACTIVE targets to patient-specific OA prediction and interventions by using a combination of mechanistic, phenomenological computational models, simulations and big data analytics. Once constructed, these models will be used to simulate and predict optimal treatments, better diagnostics, and improved patient outcomes. Overcoming the limitation of the current treatment interventions, Augmented Reality empowered interventions will be developed in a personalised framework allowing patients experience the treatment as more enjoyable, resulting in greater motivation, engagement, and training adherence.

However, the main hurdle against practical utilization of 2DMs is the lack of effective mass production and transfer techniques of high-quality 2DMs to satisfy the growing demands for scientific and technological applications. The current state-of-the-art synthesis method of 2DMs involves the adsorption of gas-phase precursors on a solid catalyst. This process is slow by nature, inefficient, and environmentally unfriendly. The produced 2DMs are often defective, contaminated, and suffering from very high residual stress, compromising their unique physio-chemical properties for the expected applications. During our ongoing FET-Open project of LMCat, we have studied a radically new synthesis method for growing 2DMs which employed a liquid metal catalyst (LMCat) instead of a solid one. Our recent experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that using LMCats bears the prospect of 2DMs with unprecedented quality and production speed. The major success of this project has motivated us to follow up on this via this industrially oriented proposal with the aim of demonstrating the possibility of continuous graphene production via performing its simultaneous growth and its direct separation from the LMCat. This is to increase the technology readiness level from TRL2 in the current FET-Open project of LMCat to TRL4 at the end of the proposed FET-Proact project of DirectSepa.

The start of this process of rifting is thought to contribute significantly to the structure and sedimentary layering of the continental margins that have formed by its end. Often the details of how rifting initiates and develops in the first few million years are lost in the complexities of deformation and thick sediment layers beneath the continent's edges. To understand the early phases, we have to study areas where rifting has only recently started, and the Gulf of Corinth, Greece, is a key example in its first few millions of years of history. Across the Gulf, the two sides of the rift are moving apart at up to 20 mm every year and this high rate of extension results in numerous earthquakes which historically have been very destructive. The rapid extension also results in a rapidly developing rift basin which is partially submerged beneath the sea and filling with sediments. \\nWithin the Gulf, a large volume of marine geophysical data has been collected, including detailed maps of the seabed, as well as seismic data that use sound sources to give cross-sections of material beneath the seabed. The seismic data allow us to directly image the accumulated sediment layers and to identify faults that offset the layers and create the basin. This project will integrate these data to make a very detailed interpretation of the sediment layers (and their likely age) and fault planes. Imaging and assigning ages to the layers, by comparing with models of climate and sea level change, allows us to determine how the basin has developed through time. The fault planes imaged by the data generate the extension and subsidence of the rift, and their history of activity controls how the basin develops. The results will be used to generate the first high resolution model of rift development over the initial few million years of a rift's history and will help to address some of the unanswered questions of how continents break apart. The model will be used by a range of scientists, including those trying to understand how tectonics, landscape morphology and climate all interact to cause sediments to move from one place to another: rift basins are one of the main sinks for sediments and we will calculate how the volume of sediment delivered to the Corinth basin has changed with time, as faults move and as climate changes. \\nThe majority of the world's petroleum resources are found in old rifts, but often details of how the rift developed and the detailed geometry of the rock units in which the oil is now found are masked by other geological processes and by shallower sediment layers. Understanding the early rift processes is important for determining where and what kind of sediments will be deposited in different parts of the basin with time. We will also analyse details of how individual faults grow and interact with other faults in the rift: this process affects where sediments enter a rift basin and is therefore also important for identifying petroleum reservoirs.\\nThe rift faults are responsible for the destructive earthquakes in central Greece, so this project's analysis of fault location and rate of slip will also help us to better understand the potential hazard, increasing the potential for reduction of associated risk.\\nUltimately, the project will be used to select sites for drilling and sampling the sediments of the rift zone, through the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. These samples would provide: the actual age of sediment layers, and hence well resolved slip rates for each active fault and a test for the rift models generated here; and the types of sediments, that will tell us more about the regional climate of the last few millions of years and where sediments that typically form hydrocarbon reservoirs are located in this analogue for older rift systems like the North Sea.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'GBP', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 208995.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_______::d9e76513e7d55c4b04fd4385897d9384', 'code': '216025', 'acronym': 'BIND', 'title': 'Biaxial Nematic Devices', 'websiteUrl': 'http://BIND.upatras.gr/', 'startDate': '2008-02-07', 'endDate': '2012-02-06', 'callIdentifier': 'FP7-ICT-2007-1', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::963abfaf52d53670e44b8305160fbcee', 'code': '101138451', 'acronym': 'PERSEPHONE', 'title': 'Autonomous Exploration and Extraction of Deep Mineral Deposits', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2024-01-01', 'endDate': '2026-12-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-CL4-2023-RESILIENCE-01', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Innovative technologies for sustainable and decarbonised extraction (RIA)'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The continuous effort and increased demand of the raw materials are directing the mining companies to excavate minerals at greater depths.

Therefore, without innovative IT solutions based on emerging technologies (e.g. IT tool with Augmented Reality glasses which displays communication commands for contacting caretakers), people with disabilities (PWDs) are isolated. The “Innovative Solutions based on Emerging Technologies for Improving Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities (INNOSID)” project builds upon ten years long activities of the “ICT-AAC Competence Network” and broadens its activities geographically (through internationalization) and technologically (through focusing on emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and 3D-printing). ICT-AAC main vision is enhancing social inclusion of PWDs by designing and developing free IT solutions aimed at enabling communication, supporting education, and raising public awareness about needs and abilities of people with disabilities. The INNOSID project will be implemented by the consortium consisting of 6 higher education institutions (HEI) and 1 non-governmental organization (NGO) from the domain of the people with disabilities, from 5 EU countries (Croatia, Spain, France, Portugal, Hungary). The project goal is to improve social inclusion of PWDs by creating innovative IT solutions based on emerging technologies. To reach the project goal, the following three equally important objectives will be fulfilled:  (i) developing a multilingual support for existing IT tools for improving social inclusion of people with disabilities; (ii) designing new innovative IT tools based on emerging technologies for improving social inclusion of people with disabilities; and (iii) improving higher education system through tackling skill gaps – raising awareness, developing open educational resources and providing training to students and lecturers in the area of innovative IT solutions based on emerging technologies.The INNOSID objectives will be achieved through delivery of the following results: (i) multilingual support for 5 ICT-AAC applications (support for Croatian, English, Spanish, Hungarian, French, Portuguese, including multilingual user guides); (ii) study on emerging technologies for improving social inclusion of people with disabilities; (iii) 4 product vision statements and specifications for IT tools for improving social inclusion of people with disabilities; (iv) 2 newly developed, free and publicly-available IT tools (software) for improving social inclusion of people with disabilities (including user guides); and (v) 20 slide decks published as Open Education Resources (OERs).In order to deliver INNOSID results, the consortium will organize and implement: (i) 4 multiplier events for disseminating project results to target groups (and broader audience); (ii) 4 learning/teaching/training (LTT) activities for providing training to students and lecturers (based on blended mobility and project-based learning) in the area of innovative IT solutions based on emerging technologies; (iii) 7 transnational project meetings to ensure project delivery tracking and quality verification; and (iv) dissemination and visibility activities based on project's web page and social media to ensure efficient communication about results to internal and external stakeholders, as well as project sustainability and impact by providing open and free access to developed IT tools, user manuals and OERs.INNOSID project target groups are: (i) people with disabilities; (ii) students from participating HEIs; (iii) lecturers (researchers) from participating HEIs; (iv) high school students; and (v) IT companies. The project will directly include a few dozen of people with disabilities through evaluation of the newly developed IT tools and participation in the multiplier events, while the number of indirectly impacted people with disabilities will be significantly higher as developed IT tools will be available for free download via Internet. Around 60 students and 35 lecturers from INNOSID consortium HEIs will be involved in learning/teaching/training activities, while around 300 high school students will participate in the INNOSID multiplier events. Several IT companies which will participate in the project will benefit from ready-to-use specifications for IT tools aimed to improve social inclusion of people with disabilities, what will help them to fulfill their corporate social responsibility function in such a way.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 311270.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'irb_hr______::b8add79dde463e04fffd9fe3c52d3a57', 'code': '275-0982705-3047', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Interaction between bicenoses in open water and coastal systems of the Adriatic', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2007-01-01', 'endDate': '2009-01-01', 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'MZOS', 'name': 'Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia (MSES)', 'jurisdiction': 'HR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::cca580f44dd0f7889f6051f9c36d4548', 'code': '818748', 'acronym': 'TPTF_ERN', 'title': \"Techno-Past Techno-Future: European Researchers' Night\", 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2018-08-01', 'endDate': '2019-10-31', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-2018', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': [\"European Researchers' Night\"], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Science, research and innovation should be and through history they have been a drive of social and economic progress.

SMEs will need new skills, competences and operational tools to better operate (or simply operate) in a new business environment.RESULTSESMERALD provides tangible and timely training solutions to those needs as it will:1. Develop a OER platform to deliver the ESMERALD training to SMEs and VET providers in eLearning and blended modalities (IO1)2. Take stock of the actual impact of COVID-19 on the real economy, map the specific impact on SMEs, screen policy and industry response to pinpoint the specific needs of SMEs in post-pandemic economy. IO2 is perfectly timed as it will start in November 2020, when the pandemic will slow and the economy restart. This is also the moment in which the real impact can be assessed, as well the renovated challenges and training needs of SMEs. Also, this is when policy response initiatives will also kick-in.3. Develop the ESMERALD training on innovative business models and entrepreneurial skills and competences for SMEs to strive in post-pandemic economy. The training will be made available for FREE and Open Access in 6 languages to enhance replicability, sustainability and impact.4. Develop guidelines to promote the adoption and use of ESMERALD in all entrepreneurship support and VET systems possible across EU5. Advance evidence-based policy making for SME resilience with the ESMERALD Manifesto as a policy input for decision makers.PARTICIPANTS of ESMERALD are 7 partners from 6 countries, representing the various facets of SME’s competitiveness and entrepreneurship.

Yet, not all Europeans are ready to fully participate in – ad contribute to – the digital society and economy. According to the European Commission, only 57% of Europeans have the digital skills needed for the digital world we live in. One in six Europeans aged 16-74 has no digital skills at all and one in four only has a low level of digital skills. Furthermore, while 90% of jobs require basic digital competences, 35% of the labour force lacks them. Moreover, 38% of EU companies report that the lack of digital skills negatively affects their performance and competitiveness.Croatia lags behind: according to the EU Commission “EU Index of Digital Entrepreneurship Systems” Croatia ranks 23 out of the 28 Member States, with particularly low rating in human capital and attitude towards digital entrepreneurship.To tackle this challenge, the EU launched the “Digital Skills &amp; Jobs Coalition” with the ambition of empowering Europeans to acquire the digital skills they need to thrive in society, remain productive and employable. The Coalition main target is to train 1 million young people for digital jobs through short-term training programmes.In this context IDEA (Inspiring Digital Entrepreneurship and Awareness in HE) project aims at fulfilling the gaps highlighted in the specific Higher Education priorities - HE: Tackling skills gaps and mismatches of the Erasmus Plus Programme, page 107 by combining training and tools targeted to 2 different set of skills equally needed to boost effectiveness of HE curricula and magnify HE students’ chances of success: Digital Skills and Entrepreneurial skills.  Through its activities and outputs, IDEA proposes an innovative approach of one important factor influencing entrepreneurial success: the use of digital skills applied to entrepreneurship. One of the first crucial trait of highly successful entrepreneurs is the ability to keep up with the latest trends (social, technological, economical). ”Digital Transformation of European Industry and Enterprises” report shows that the transformative power of digital is enormous and unexploited.  Europe could create up to 1.5 million new jobs in the Internet economy.The project will be implemented by 9 partners from Croatia, Poland, Belgium, Romania, Italy, Spain, Slovakia from different backgrounds (business/ICT field, HE Institutions and social partners/NGO) over a period of 24 months.IDEA has the objective of mapping and stock taking of Digital Entrepreneurship dynamics in the countries involved, by identifying common trends, issues, best practices and tools. IDEA will boost both digital skills and entrepreneurship by developing and testing a set of innovative materials and resources, which allow HEIs equipping at least 200 HE students of the participating organizations with two crucial entrepreneurial success skills: digital skills applied to entrepreneurship skills by the end of the project. IDEA will also deploy project results throughout Europe via its OER platform destined to become a knowledge hub and an open education focal point.IDEA will rise awareness among HE Institutions and education authorities concerning the potential of digital skills and entrepreneurship skills and their role as business success factors.IDEA main aim is to improve professional success chances of HE students with different backgrounds by developing not only their entrepreneurship skills (or knowledge), but also their digital skills.  Target groups: HE students and recent graduates, HE teachers, trainers/mentors HE schools/institutions, social partners, companies, SMEs.In order to reach the project’s aim, development of 4 innovative and transferrable intellectual outputs is foreseen: O1: IDEA Open Education Resources OER Platform available in 7 languagesIO2: IDEA mapping and stock taking of Digital Entrepreneurship dynamics in the countries involved, identification of common trends, issues, best practices and tools;IO3: IDEA E-learning training material for Students on Digital Entrepreneurship Training for Entrepreneurial Success;IO4: Test and validation with 200 students, mainstream and uptake with consequent development of Digital Entrepreneurship Manual and Guidelines for HEIs.Measures for open access and sustainability are planned, to ensure the usability of the project beyond project’s lifetime.

As recent Covid-19 pandemic exposed, in times of crisis virtual teams become only means of functioning even for activities of intrinsically oriented organizations. Being able to work in virtual teams is one of basic skills essential for employability of prospective graduates. However, while different aspects of digital transformation are covered in educational programmes of higher education institutions (HEIs) and even some high schools, the clear focus on building of skills for work in virtual teams is lacking. This should come as no surprise as currently the knowledge of the virtual team working skills is only emerging, consisting of two more profound scientific articles based on desk research and surveys (published in 2016, and 2017 by S. Krumm and colleagues). The problem with these knowledge resources is that they have mainly used top-down quantitative approach in the knowledge generation which delimits what we can now about the phenomena of virtual team working skills needed in the future. For European society to prosper in a digital era there is the need to empower European youth to harness benefits of work in virtual, multi-cultural teams in a bottom up approach.The main aim of the project VIBES (Virtual Business Skills Empowerment) is to enhance students virtual teamworking competences to cope better in today`s global working environment and create and develop entrepreneurial opportunities for the European single market. The project will deliver study module (s) with process descriptions of the learning outcomes, learning methods as integrated processes, lists of supportive tools and assessment methods and criteria. We will use “best practice “from each country to start with and share and develop collaborative approaches to building virtual teams’ capabilities. By co-creating innovative approaches to support collaborative capabilities, networking opportunities, and innovation and strategic skills development, our aim is to support two targeted areas. We aim to develop the innovation and entrepreneurial capabilities of the students and to support the extension of these capabilities and modules as potential development resources for SME’s that need innovative intrapreneurs. The point is to develop and extend innovative virtual teams to produce new entrepreneurial business capabilities and opportunities, while developing a more sustainable individual skillset that can more readily adapt and create emerging market opportunities. Rather than training people for existing roles which are rapidly becoming obsolete VIBES aims at developing an entrepreneurial attitude to understand that a constant evolution of individual and organizational capabilities is needed as a response to emergent opportunities. We believe that improving the capabilities of individuals to effectively participate in virtual transnational teams is a viable approach to sustainable economic development.Virtual collaboration space will be created on an existing platform. In this space, we share the learning materials after which the space starts to live its own life: teachers implement the module, share their experiences, and suggest ideas how to do better and differently. In addition, multiplier effect should serve the purpose of presenting intellectual results and transaction for interorganizational as well as intercultural collaboration and exchange.The project VIBES (Virtual Business Skills Empowerment) aims to tackle two types of skills relevant for future employability of young Europeans with university and high school education, in a digital era and the ability of companies to tap into global pool of talent: The ability to work in virtual multi-cultural teams. Challenges of work in virtual teams are multifaceted as such teams cope with lack of conventional trust building mechanisms, barriers to communication are significant due to absence of visual cues such as body language and facial expressions and team conflict resolution is often more challenging that in conventional teams. Rapport building and coping with feelings of isolation further add to the long list of challenges associated with working in virtual teams. Particularly important issue in contemporary context is the multi-cultural dimension. Cultural diversity poses challenge in business communication by itself but its relevance is even more emphasized in virtual environment. Success of such teams depends on the ability of individual teams to define goals and roles but also to possess management skills relevant for consistency, individual support, empathy, and management of cross-cultural differences. Functioning of virtual teams depends on technology and individuals engaged in such teams should possess sufficient level of technological knowledge for efficient and effective communication and performing of tasks with other team members.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 211105.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'irb_hr______::a3f67934b391138dd241d81143f56dc3', 'code': 'IP-2013-11-3782', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Framing the Nation and Collective Identity in Croatia: Political Rituals and the Cultural Memory of Twentieth Century Traumas', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2014-06-10', 'endDate': '2018-06-09', 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'HRZZ', 'name': 'Croatian Science Foundation (CSF)', 'jurisdiction': 'HR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::28732c8574451ebc3dc056100b3b640e', 'code': '101093822', 'acronym': 'SeaClear2.0', 'title': 'Scalable Full-cycle Marine Litter Remediation in the Mediterranean: Robotic and Participatory Solutions', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2023-01-01', 'endDate': '2026-12-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-03', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Mediterranean sea basin lighthouse - actions to prevent, minimise and remediate litter and plastic pollution'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'SeaClear2.0 will develop a holistic approach to address the full cycle of marine litter, towards the Mission to restore, protect and preserve the health of our oceans, seas and waters by 2030.

At the same time, the strengthening of environmental awareness has brought the need to visit less classic tourist destinations, with a high concentration of tourist contents, and locations in nature reserves, far from cities and with clear environmental protection policies are gaining priority. With this in mind, tourist locations are becoming more environmentally friendly and an increasing number of visitors aim to assess the environmental sustainability of hotels and holiday destinations. It has gradually evolved into a movement that favours local culture, destinations in rural areas, preserved nature reserves, and SPAs, rather than mass tourism (OECD Tourism Trends and Policies, 2016). In line with the preferences of consumers of tourist services, the possession of green skills by employees in tourism and hospitality is becoming indispensable. According to EU Commission Skills panorama (2015) environmental awareness skills refer to the knowledge, abilities, values and attitudes needed to live in, develop and support a society that reduces the impact of human activity on the environment. These generic ‘green’ skills include the capacity to include environmental concerns alongside others (such as performance and safety) in taking decisions, including in the choice of processes and technologies. A special segment of tourism that is the most demanding in terms of required skills is certainly the hotel industry. It is in this sector that green practices are increasingly being developed and implemented, which entails the need for the green skills of employees.The project ESSEFT is designed to tackle down the problem of a skills mismatch in each partner country that rises due to new requirements set in the hotel management and modern requirements from employees in the tourism industry. The project involves the development of short-cycle courses (lasting three months), which would complement the knowledge of work-age adults employed in the field of tourism and hospitality, and which relate to the development of their green skills. In addition, the course will be offered to students in the field of tourism in order to harmonize classical education with the future demands of the labour market through specific training that provide an innovative approach and attractive skills as an outcome. Finally, the developed training programme will involve Learning outcomes will be verified by certificates of completed courses, which should contribute to a better position of both work age employees and students in the labour market, i.e. to facilitate during the school-to-work or job-to-job transitions. Courses as such are not part of the compulsory curriculum of vocational studies, do not bring ECTS, but can be a supplement to diplomas and bring a certificate of acquired skills during the course, with a detailed course curriculum. In addition to the environmental aspect of business, which is reflected in the application of the principles of circular economy, waste separation and recycling, as well as the use of renewable energy sources in tourist facilities, a special segment of short-cycle courses will be the digital and paperless approach to teaching and training activities.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;An overall project goal is to enhance green skills, knowledge, values and attitudes of both work age adults and students in the field of tourism, to develop and support sustainable social, economic and environmental outcomes in the tourism industry and the local community. The ESSEFT project aims at overcoming the green skills mismatch of working-age adults employed in the tourism and hospitality industry, focusing on mitigating hotels workforce green skill mismatch as a specific skill competitive part of the tourism industry and facilitate job to job transition of this group. The secondary targeted group are students in the field of tourism and improvements of their green skills in order to enhance their opportunities in school-to-work transition.Above mentioned problems and priority will be addressed by the following specific project objectives:1) Research green skills mismatch in the field of tourism at the labour market;2) Engage professionals from profit organizations in the teaching process in order to transfer their professional experience in the field of green skills to both for working-age adults to successfully manage labour market transitions as well to vocational students in order to mitigate problems of school to work transition;3) Engage typically university teaching tools in acquiring green competencies to achieve innovation in vocational education and training (fostering intersectoral cooperation between HEI and VET; short cycle courses as a usual tool of HEIs implemented in VET), and the increasing attractiveness of VET;4) Build digitally available new curriculums and learning platform focused on labour market needs in the field of green skills application in the tourism and hospitality industry;5) Produce digitally available materials for educational courses (develop learning platform, textbooks, exercises and tasks) focused on zero paper usage;6) Deliver short-cycle learning courses for students in the field of sustainable and eco-friendly tourism will be awarded a certificate;7) Make recommendations for policymakers based on the project results.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;The stated objectives will be addressed by the following activities:•defining the context and status of working-age adults and students in green skills mismatches at the national and international level;•including long-term unemployed as the participants with fewer opportunities at the labour market;•exploring the preferences of consumers targeting those who are inclined to choose for their vacation hotels that apply green practices;•developing training activities for acquiring green competencies by professionals from profit organizations at the international level;•developing learning curriculums based on identified labour market needs in green procedures in the hotel industry;•developing online learning platform and delivering lectures through it with a few face-to-face learning activities for short-cycle learning courses;•awarding developed skills with certificate and measure students’ satisfaction with this innovative learning methodology to act proactively in up-dating VET course’ curriculums;•making policy recommendations related to the changes in VET learning programs addressing green skills and competencies for sustainable and eco-friendly tourism.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;The project will deliver four intellectual outputs as the results of the above activities:1.Report on labour market green skills mismatch in tourism and hospitality industry;2.Handbook Green skills and sustainable and eco-friendly tourism and customized ESSEFT short-cycle learning course curriculum including six successive pieces of training covering different areas of green procedures in the hotel industry;3.ESSEFT online learning platform;4.ESSEFT short-cycle learning courses implementation and policy recommendations.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 171395.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::8266c2ab3f58f7d8e3cdcad43e282124', 'code': '2021-1-TR01-KA220-VET-000024755', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Innovative curriculum to evaluate MARIne fishery discards as raw PET food for sustainable Europe', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': 'Agriculture, forestry and fisheries; Environment and climate change; Creating new, innovative or joint curricula or courses', 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': '\"&lt;&lt; Background &gt;&gt;Over three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. However, today we are seeing 30 percent of the world’s fish stocks overexploited. FAO estimates that total fish production is 179 million tonnes in 2018 and about 88% of the mentioned amount was utilized for human consumption directly and the rest (12%) was described as used for “non-food purposes” and “waste”. Reducing by-catch and discard is an important issue for fishery management. Not only ecological impacts on biodiversity but also economical losses are enormously tragedic problems worldwide. To reduce these effects, there are many studies carried out by fisheries engineers, especially the selectivity of fishing gears. Although many of these studies have positive results, it can be said that the fishermen are not very successful in practice due to commercial concerns. More than 40 fish species are caught per operation in bottom-trawl fishing, especially in Mediterranean waters because of its multi-species fishery characteristics. Among these, species that are discarded for various reasons besides those that are evaluated commercially have a significant amount in the total catch. A large proportion of fisheries production (35 percent of the global harvest) is either lost or wasted. In this context, it has become necessary to produce strategic solutions related to the increasing world population and decreasing food resources. Reformed Common Fisheries Policy requires fisheries operating in the EU to bring all discarded individuals back to shore. For this, it is aimed to provide training on the possibilities of using discarded fishery products as pet food by bringing them to shore. MARIPET Project intends to create an awareness to use discard products by captured-based fisheries into the pet food industry. Although fish meal and fish oil which are the most valuable feed ingredients in the fish feed industry have been produced by using discarded fishes, it needs still a huge amount of investment to create economically valuable products. By contrast, most of the discarded fishes can be used as “Biologically Appropriate Raw Food” (BARF). The barf diet is obtained by blending foods that are useful and nutritious for cats and dogs in certain proportions. It means biologically suitable raw foods which is a diet that has been formulated taking into account the diet of cats and dogs in their evolutionary process.As explained above, the content of MARIPET aims to plan getting different industries such as fisheries, animal nutrition and pet food production together with the support of different professions such as fisheries experts, veterinarians, seafood specialists and pet food producers. MARIPET gives enough importance to valorize discarded fish that has been increasing day by day. MARIPET was prepared because the transformation of discarded fish into a pet food ingredient is almost a new subject and it requires several professions as it is a multidisciplinary project. While discarded fish itself does mean “waste” only, the transformation of discarded fish into pet food or one of its ingredients points out an economical value chain. The first requirement is bringing different experts and institutions together to create a training program. The main theme of MARIPET includes more than one value chain step from the marine environment to pet food plant and any single step can create a difference itself. The project activities with their valuable experts and institutions will deliver several courses to explain the whole process plan and an economical program of this new sector. Providing a sustainable business plan will need a platform; because both fisheries and the pet food industry develop rapidly. It will work in such a central harbor; so the project experts and trained participants will continue to use the updated information for their sectors.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;With the implementation of the project, the possibilities of using discarded fish species that arise as a result of commercial fishing activities and cannot be evaluated in animal feeding will be revealed. It is an undeniable fact that with this goal to be achieved, effective solutions to some ecological problems created by climate changes will be brought. Sustainable food management is absolutely necessary in order to benefit more efficiently from the share allocated to human consumption due to the increasing world population and decreasing food resources. However, enabling the use of some of the wasted marine products in animal nutrition will once again reveal how important an ecosystem approach fisheries policy is. By 2030, UNDP (United Nation\\'s Development Agency) aims to double the income of families engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry, while also reducing exploited stocks by half. All country leaders in the united nations have signed this goal in \"\"Life Below Water\"\", which is the 14th title of the sustainable development goals. That is why it has become an extremely important mission to combat the pressure on food stocks caused by climate change and global warming. For this purpose, important duties fall on all professions related to food. With the implementation of practices created by MARIPET fisheries engineers on by-catch and discard management, nourishing marine products will be thrown back into the sea. In this way, it will be possible to gain maximum benefit from exploited stocks by bringing the discarded species that have died or about to die to the economy. It is estimated that 85 million European households own at least one pet animal and 49% of them are dog and cat. Annual sales of pet food products are 8.5 billion tonnes and turnover of pet food products €21 billion EUR. With the realization of the MARIPET project, it is desired that a sustainable and ecosystem-approached raw material (discarded fish) can be integrated into the European pet food industry, which grows 2.6% annually. Veterinarians, food engineers and other partners of the MARIPET project, will provide added value to pet nutrition technology with the feed experts in the project. With the implementation of the project subject, which was created with a multidisciplinary perspective, the success of contributing to the ecological and economic sustainability of food stocks will be achieved. The most innovative aspect of the project is that it creates the first vocational training curriculum on the production of BARF for pet animals from discarded marine fish.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;The most important argument of the MARIPET project activities is to increase the awareness of the waste of food stocks caused by the fishery discard, which is unknown to a significant part of the society. In this context, it will be the most important movement for the chain effect to begin if the commercial fishing fleets, which are at the root of the problem, learn that there are opportunities to reduce their economic losses. The process, which will start with the retaining of the discarded fish while keeping the cold chain, will allow this valuable nutrient resource to be utilized as a raw material. In this way, target groups in the project center such as fisheries engineers, veterinarians, food engineers and of course pet food producers will be enabled to take a role in sustainable food management. As a result, the MARIPET project will ensure the economic development of the target groups whose awareness is increased through educational activities, while transforming the fishery discard, which is an ecological tragedy and wasted, into healthy food for our animal friends will achieve the planned results.MARIPET aims to create sector professionals to develop the cooperation between fisheries and pet food. Although the transformation of discarded fish to a pet food ingredient looks like a simple process, in reality, management of each step initiating from the fishing vessel finalizing in the digestive tract of the pet requires a very good profession. MARIPET, providing a full package of the training program, will train the fishermen who will focus on the valorization of discarded fish which is an additional making money model and keeping cold chain to the harbor where their job has just completed; but fisheries experts, veterinarians and pet food producers have just initiated. Transportation of fresh meat without microbiological damage, its analysis, transforming of discarded fish into an ingredient and its nutritional analysis, preparation of pet food formulation and pet food production methods are all a complete package that MARIPET will provide professional information and service to the participants. The dataset of all steps will be new for most of the project partners and training participants; so creating a dynamic share platform will support the sustainability of the created process model and it will be updated by the MARIPET professionals.The dissemination kit and the main tool used to disseminate MARIPET results will be social networking sites (Instagram, Linkedin, youtube), local, national press, TV channels, workshops with stakeholders, meetings with target groups, organizations, meetings with fishermen, representatives of the animal food sector and municipalities. University teams will also encourage students to use the project website and learn about the management of fishery discards, reduction of food waste and usage of discarded fish for healthy animal food. They also focus on communicating results to all stakeholders in the field of fisheries management and healthy animal food, environmental, ecological, ecological and sustainable food resources.-The MARIPET web portal and visual identity will be launched in the first four months of the project.-Face-to-face meeting (workshops, seminars, conferences) -Promotional material (brochures, leaflets, newsletters) will be disseminated during agricultural fairs, workshops, seminars, conferences and regional advisory centers and similar institutions, both in the form of public information material and information on their websites; advertisements and articles on the MARIPET project in fishery, agricultural and popular magazines.-There are regional, national/international TV channels and newspapers that have very good relations with the municipalities of İZMİR and BALIKESİR. These partners will continue to pursue television program objectives and evaluate these opportunities as much as they can.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;Discards in fishery create an important time-wasting, a huge economical source loss and also ecological tragedy. The first outcome of MARIPET is to increase awareness about this negative impact and push sectoral professionals to spend their effort to reduce it. There are many studies carried out by fisheries engineers, especially the selectivity of fishing gears. Although many of these studies have positive results, it can be said that the fishermen are not very successful in practice due to commercial concerns. Because the efforts to reduce discard are also partially reducing the catch of commercial species. Unfortunately, commercial concerns that this fact creates on fishermen often make fisheries engineers\\' discard reduction solutions out of the way. In reality, most of the scientific studies stress that reducing discard in the fishery is not such an easy process and today’s captured-based fisheries techniques do not manage to remove it successfully. Although it cannot be prevented completely, using logical solutions, discarded fish can be transformed to different sources that become economical products for different sectors. MARIPET accepts that fish, even economical for human nutrition or discarded, have a high nutritional value. This idea created the major result that discarded fish can be used as an ingredient for the pet food industry. The second targeted result of the project is to exhibit the transformation steps and procedure by using a training module for sectoral professionals consisted of fishermen to pet food producers. While the training program is delivered by the project professionals, an economical business model will be also exhibited. MARIPET aims not only to create a training program but to establish a sustainable transformation chain as an economical policy for fisheries and pet food production. One of the other important results is to build a sharing platform for the project experts, training participants and related sector representatives. As the project underlined several times, fisheries and pet food sectors are developing very rapidly and the experience that will be obtained from the project activities has a big potential to get old rapidly, too. The platform will keep the project subject quite dynamic providing updated information that will come from the MARIPET professionals and the plenary dynamic action has a big potential to take this transformation sector to industry.The main results of the MARIPET will be:Innovative curriculum including 5 modules with training coursesA virtual dedicated environment with an online education kit Establishment of discard fisheries and pet food trainers/experts platform - European Discard Fisheries and Pet Food Production Guidebook/e-book Training workshopsMultiplier events in five countriesQuality Management and dissemination reports\"', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 262050.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'irb_hr______::109f0f7cce60b2aab730063eba6608ba', 'code': '275-0000000-3260', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Integral Quality of Service of Communications and Information Systems', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2007-01-01', 'endDate': '2009-01-01', 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'MZOS', 'name': 'Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia (MSES)', 'jurisdiction': 'HR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_______::af736e488cc12f5dd29225e269e0574e', 'code': '222492', 'acronym': 'ENRICH', 'title': 'ENRICHMENT OF AQUACULTURE IMPLANTS BY INTRODUCTION OF NEW MARINE SPECIES FROM THE WILD TO BREEDING.', 'websiteUrl': 'http://www.enrichnet.eu', 'startDate': '2008-12-01', 'endDate': '2011-05-31', 'callIdentifier': 'FP7-SME-2007-1', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::a7eecf6ab5eae6b06820d832aa3fa598', 'code': '101134929', 'acronym': 'ONE-BLUE', 'title': 'Integrated approach to assess the levels and impact of cONtaminants of Emerging concern on BLUE health and biodiversity modulated by climate change drivers.', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2024-01-01', 'endDate': '2027-06-30', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Integrated assessment and monitoring of emerging pollutants in the marine environment'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'ONE-BLUE will provide an integrated assessment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and their impacts, will develop new monitoring tools, and will provide an advanced understanding of the combined effects of CECs and climate change (CC) on the different marine ecosystems and their biodiversity.

The project is designed to yield three tangible outputs: a training manual, a guided video course, and a case report of best practices in implementing the course. Participating students will benefit from improved personal faculties, such as self-efficacy, self-awareness, and self-confidence, which drive entrepreneurial intentions, actions, and success.First, the partners will jointly develop a course manual comprised of a theoretical foundation on the methods employed as well as practical exercises for students to reflect on themselves, set goals, and plan their implementation. The course manual will be used to design and record a video course to help facilitate the presentation and delivery of the contents in the course manual. The addition of a video course will make the students' participation in the training a multisensory experience when compared to merely reading the manual, which has been shown to improve learning effectivity. Following the recording of the video course, the partner organizations will conduct a baseline assessment of their students' proficiency in self-leadership skills and entrepreneurial cognition and mindset. Afterwards, each organization will teach the course to their enrolled students and, then, repeat the assessment. The results will be compared to those of a wait-list control group. This allows conclusions to be drawn as to the effectiveness of the course material in training the skills and abilities that the course was designed to train. The organizations will engage in scientifically rigorous methods of analysis to explore whether a causal link between a participation between a student's participation in the training and an improvement in their personal entrepreneurial skills and mindset can be established. Each partner will create an individual case report on the experiences they acquired during the teaching of the course at their institution. These case reports will then be collated, compared, and conflated to form an overarching case study, which serves as guidance for third party organizations that wish to teach the developed course material to their students after this project is completed. The partners will meet in person several times over the course of the projects to exchange learnings and best practices acquired and to plan the implementation of upcoming milestones in detail.In the long term, the project will help students to become more responsible citizens by equipping them with the necessary tools, abilities, and cognitions to identify and pursue entrepreneurial ventures successfully. This can be done not only in the creation of standalone start-up companies, but also within the framework of established organizations which aim to drive innovativeness and have to rely on employees who possess the entrepreneurial spirit and skills. These skills to achieve success are further transferable to the implementation of a wide variety of personal endeavors in the realms of hobbies or passions, further fostering the students' feelings of self-efficacy and self-worth. Further, the course material will be made accessible for free to individuals across the globe, allowing them to prosper independent of their location. This, in turn, will prove beneficial not only for those participating students but also for society as a whole.

Some 71% of respondents claim that lack of skills is one of the key barriers to innovation.The EU Commission “SME Strategy: for Sustainable &amp; Digital Europe” Mar 2020 calls for Member States and the VET system to modernise their support to SMEs so that they can innovate and be more sustainable in their growth and role for job creation. The SME strategy clearly calls for the provision of training to become more “innovative” on its own, be able to accommodate the needs of SMEs to be more dynamic and responsive to the changing dynamics of the market.A major barrier that undermines EU SMEs’ ability to innovate is the inability to spur, mobilise and valorise the inherent talent and innovation capacity already within the enterprise. This is typically associated with lack of capacity and tools for management of SMEs and staff to overcome traditional mindsets and unleash the potential of “open innovation”. While Open Innovation happens at corporate level (i.e. large companies), SMEs are still anchored to old-fashion models, where the entrepreneurs/managers lead and the staff/employees execute.GENIE is an innovative project that develops training and tools to ignite Intrapreneurship in Micro/Small&amp;Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Intrapreneurship has the potential of involving and engaging staff and management in MSMEs to develop new ideas, business and management processes, products and services to sustain MSMEs’ innovation, competitiveness, growthA wealth of literature, data and research converges on the need for SMEs to reinvent the way they work and operate. Above all (and also to consolidate the national reports and analysis), the EU Commission Policy Brief “Protect, Prepare &amp; Transform: Recovery &amp; Resilience post COVID” simplifies and summarizes the key concepts of:1. Resilience by design, not by disaster: EU MSMEs need to “think innovatively” and not react to emergencies2. Deep transformation for sustainability and resilience: MSMEs need to “rethink” how they work, revolutionize their inner selves to be more sustainable and resilient3. Innovate with and for people: MSMEs are not intangible entities, but made of people…innovation does not happen at organizational level without involving peopleIntrapreneurship embodies the 3 elements above in the context of micro and small enterprise: deep internal transformation, to involve and enable people in the company to be more resilient, sustainable and innovativeTarget groups of the project are represented by:1 staff member of micro and small enterprises needing to upgrade their skills and abilities to contribute to companies innovation and competitiveness thanks to models of intrapreneurship2 managers of MSME who need tools and training to be able to implement correctly mechanisms of intrapreneurship and identify and nurture talent of their staff3 VET providers and operators who need to upgrade and update their offering and service provision two the entire entrepreneurship support system and companies to implement correctly intrapreneurship to support innovation growth and competitivenessNEED: upgrade competences on intrapreneurshipSOLUTION: develop concrete trainingNEED: support in implementing intrapreneurship at enterprise levelSOLUTION: develop and deliver the GENIE tools to develop and implement intrapreneurship strategies and programsNEED: MSMEs lack time and resources (financial) to access new trainingSOLUTION: GENIE OER platform makes the content, training and tools on intrapreneurship FREE and OPEN Access anytimeNEED: innovative tools to embed learning/training in work-related settings to entice the attention and focus of learnersSOLUTION: GENIE has a strong gamification component that is based on innovative internal management models, human resources mechanisms, staff and role play, simulation&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;GENIE has the very clear and concrete objective of “contributing to the competitiveness, growth and innovation of micro and small enterprises through the development of innovative training tools, solutions and content”. This overarching objective of the project is then articulated into specific objectives of:- upgrade VET provision with innovative content on entrepreneurship development- develop new VET solutions and gamification- improve the involvement of MSMEs’ staff in the growth and competitiveness prospects of enterprises- enhance work-based learning opportunities for people already in employment and new entrants into labor market through jobs in MSMEsGENIE is a project inspired by gamification and intrapreneurship for enhanced VET solutions in support of microenterprises’ competitiveness. The acronym of the project is not accidental: our project recalls the “magic spirit” traditionally depicted as imprisoned in a bottle (or oil lamp), and capable of granting wishes when summoned by scratching the bottle/lamp.With great imagination from partners at proposal writing, our project is innovative as it has the ambition of being a “genie in the lamp” for many microenterprises across EU. GENIE has a strong gamification component, but not in the “traditional” meaning of gamification. GENIE’s approach to gamification is based on the concept of innovative Human Resource Management model of engaging and enticing staff members within an organisation to come together and experiment with innovative techniques of teamwork, role play that culminate into intrapreneurshipGENIE requires – and produces EU added value thanks to it – a truly transnational collaborative effort to:1. materialize the transnational confrontation and exchange between different entrepreneurial realities. GENIE brings together countries that have a strong connotation of microenterprise and can each contribute greatly to creating a European product thanks to the diversity of the partners representing different approaches to the same challenge (think of Germany, Italy and Spain)2. the diversity of the organisations represented amplifies the cross-border dimension of GENIE: all partners are VET providers (in different environments and contexts), and all of them are involved in entrepreneurship support3. the diversity above materializes in a truly cross-border and transnational dimension allowing GENIE to broker the exchange from and between different realities, methodologies, working mechanisms and entrepreneurship modelsGENIE brings together different perspectives of entrepreneurship, VET, services for MSMEs. This is a great innovation at process level, as the co-creation among those entities will empower our GENIE to become a powerful tool for micro &amp; small enterprises to be more competitive thanks to intrapreneurshipGENIE develops new training solutions, modules and content that is Cedefop compliant (for learning outcome) and aligned with EQF. Moreover, GENIE is an operationalization of the EntreComp Framework as it blends intrapreneurship with elements of DIgComp 2.1 and EntreComp Frameworks of the EU Commission. More, GENIE also benchmarks its training tools and solutions with other EU relevant tools, such as EURES, Europass and ESCO&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;1. partners will first establish the digital identity of the project and formal “online storage” of all project’s results, relevant news and updates. Users will be able to access the content (PR2 mapping report, PR3 training content, PR4 Adoption suite and decalogue, etc.) completely for FREE – no log in credentials will be ever required. The content will be also available for download, use and reuse in compliance with the “open access to research and data” as highlighted by the programme guide at page 14. The platform will remain available (FREE and OPEN) for 3 additional years2. In conjunction with PR1, partners will kickstart the mapping and research activities on relevant trends and dynamics for intrepreneruship models in microenterprise level. A common methodology for the assessment will be developed and shared among partners by IHF so as to assure comparability of findings and common operative guidelinesThe analysis will highlight: •qualitative dynamics •quantitative data/statistics •tangible skills-gaps •concrete needs assessment•further challenges •opportunities and best practices The strengthen and enlarge the sample of results, each partner will conduct the assessment in reference to their specific national context. IHF, as EU think thank and centre specialised in research on EU policies and practices, will focus on the EU/int. level. Findings and results of common reference will be rendered into a comprehensive executive summary 3. based on the above analysis, partners will start to develop the training material and its gamification design. The training content will be organised in training module (macro-topics). Each training module will be divided in further sub-didactic units so as to facilitate learning from targets and the organisation of the training programme for tutors/coaches. Each partner will provide a review of another partner’s content so as to assure for reliability and homogeneity of the contentUpon positive feedbacks from all partners, the consortium will enter into the validation phase w/150 targets (cumulative number). PR3 leader will develop a Validation Plan that will provide guidance on how to structure the teaching activities, which tools to be used to collect feedback and comments from users. The performance standards is settled at least 70% of positive feedbacks. PR3 will conclude with the finetuning of the training material based on targets’ feedbacks4. Partners will develop the official digital legacy of GENIE, instrumental to sustain opportunities for its further replicability beyond the partnership and the EU co-financing cycle. This will allow other formal VET providers and groups of interest to exploit project results and reuse them in their operational context for GENIE-like initiatives. PR4 considers both the domain of (a) practice and (b) policy: a) “GENIE Adoption Suite” is the set of guidelines for users in microenterprises and in the VET system to uptake, adapt and adopt the GENIE training and boardgameb) “Intrapreneurship in Microenterprise VET Decalogue” is the operational document that is meant to be the “Call To Action” for the stakeholders and representatives of the worlds of VET, micro entrepreneurship development/promotion/support and microenterprises and their staffers&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;Being the GENIE project designed to ignite entrepreneurial initiative among employees, EntreComp seemed to partners the most consistent theoretical model to design the outcomes expected during the project and after its completion. Outcomes matches all competences highlighted by the framework as key triggers for an entrepreneurial mindset:•INCREASED SENSE OF SELF-INITIATIVETargets will be better empowered to:>identify (business opportunities) for value-generation>brainstorm creative ideas>develop a long-term vision>valuing and reasoning on business ideas•INCREASED SENSE OF SELF-EFFICACY (mobilizing, organizing and matching resources)>identify and assess the operational context>nurture their business and financial literacy>remain motivated and focused>increase their resiliency and flexibility>mobile others•INCREASED SENSE OF SELF-RELIABILITY>overcoming challenges with self-made solutions>planning and managing: setting priorities>coping with risk and uncertainty>coordinating tasks and roles>learning-by-doingDuring proposal, partners designed 4 PRs based on a “staged methodological approach” that are instrumental to facilitate and sustain the acquisition from targets of the aforementioned capabilities:PR1 the GENIE OER platform represents the main mean for project’s visibility and exploitation at international level of best practices for “intrepreneurial” training. It stands as the “online identity” of the project and online community of practice dedicated to soft skill and self-empowerment for employability, upskilling, education and training. As such, PR1 is also the digital storage of all project results, relevant news from the community of practice, and more in general, GENIE progresses. The Platform (and its content) will remain available in FREE and OPEN access for 3 years after the formal conclusion of the projectPR2 is the innovative GENIE Model of Intrapreneurship in Micro/Small&amp;Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). PR2 outlines mechanisms for MSMEs to implement intrapreneurship involving and engaging staff and management to develop new ideas, business and management processes, products and services-all to sustain MSMEs’ innovation, competitiveness, growth. PR2 is composed of:>best practices and case scenario that might be readapted to GENIE operation settings>drivers, inhibitors and challenges for nurturing intrepreneurial spirits at MSMEs leve>quanti/qualitative trends pertaining to the phenomenon>executive summary detailing main findings and results from EU and country-level ecosystemsPR3 based on PR2 findings, partners will consolidate and upload on the Platform a set of training materials in “gamificated” version that will nurture and strengthen targets’ sense of initiative and intrepreneurial spirit. A preliminary outline of the training is as follows:1.Intrapreneurship: hope, hype&amp;reality. Definition and examples2.Employee Vs Intrapreneur: boundaries3.Intrapreneurial Attitude&amp;Features4.AARRR Model Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral, Revenue5.Pirate Fennel in MSME6.Pitching to your boss: the most challenging elevator pitch7.Making things happen8.Identify benefits for your MSME: strike the balance9.Change management for intraprenseurship: experiment, tolerate failure, recognize success, share wealthThe GENIE training model will be tested in pilot version w/150 targetsPR4 is conceived as the digital legacy of the project so as to sustain its further uptake and exploitation from other stakeholders of relevance. 2 deliverables are foreseen:>The “GENIE Adoption Suite” that is the set of guidelines for users in microenterprises and in the VET system to uptake, adapt and adopt the GENIE training and boardgame>The “Intrapreneurship in Microenterprise VET Decalogue” is the operational document that is meant to be the “Call To Action” for the stakeholders and representatives of the worlds of VET, micro entrepreneurship development/promotion/support and microenterprises and their staffers', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 272543.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'irb_hr______::3faf89a6bb02dc037c0d99537b3145e6', 'code': '03.01/70', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Učinak temperature i saliniteta na fiziološki odgovor školjkaša mekanog sedimenta', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2010-03-22', 'endDate': '2012-02-03', 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'HRZZ', 'name': 'Croatian Science Foundation (CSF)', 'jurisdiction': 'HR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'irb_hr______::dd418fbc0743f82fa377b948945ec5b8', 'code': '275-0000000-3628', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'Bioecological characteristic of nektonic and benthic organisms in South Adriatic', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2007-01-01', 'endDate': '2009-01-01', 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'MZOS', 'name': 'Ministry of Science, Education and Sports of the Republic of Croatia (MSES)', 'jurisdiction': 'HR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'erasmusplus_::eb8a2f657d98a80044ebee154120003a', 'code': '101082557', 'acronym': None, 'title': 'AFISHE - Development of Aquaculture and Fisheries Education for Green Deal in Armenia and Ukraine: from education to ecology', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': None, 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The overall goal of this project is to decrease the negative impact of aquaculture and fishery industry on the environment in Armenia and Ukraine through the designing and development of Master’s degree programs in aquaculture and fisheries, that is benchmarked to high-quality similar programs in Europe and responsive to national and regional needs, and strengthening the university-enterprise-research cooperation (concept “from education to ecology”). AFISHE project will create a network between Armenia, Ukraine and EU partner countries in the fields of aquaculture and fisheries. This network will serve as a platform for the implementation of joint educational and research activities with the purpose of promoting the best ecology-based approaches and activities in these fields in line with SDG goals and Green Deal. AFISHE project will strengthen university-enterprises cooperation resulting in the implementation of research-based and ecology-based operations and increasing operational effectiveness of aquaculture and fishery enterprises. The main activities of the project are the creation and development of Master’s degree study programs with all supporting materials, the establishment of laboratories, and the training of teaching and non-teaching staff of Armenia and Ukraine.

The project aims to alleviate this problem by bringing Universities and enterprises closer together by establishing University-Enterprise Cooperation Networks. Through a range of activities (such as arranging internships for students at partner companies and involving qualified staff of companies in giving lectures at the universities and mentoring students who want to complete their projects and theses in companies) arranged by their newly established Liaison Offices, universities aim at building a programme of cooperation and developing student’s knowledge of the world of work.The project involves upgrading and updating of the capacities of University staff and improve the curricula of at least ten subjects in each university. Study periods to EU universities will be arranged to provide the updating and upgrading opportunities for Jordanian and Lebanese academic and technical staff during which they can improve their own knowledge of the latest development in their subjects and also upgrade the curricula of their subjects. The upgrading of the curricula consists of enhancing both scientific and technical skills of students as well as their employability skills.

Additionally, the COVID-19 crisis imposed a rapid changeover to digital teaching, which confronted educational institutions with unexpected challenges, not only at a technological level but also at pedagogical and didactics level. Educators are individually facing challenges, which should be tackled on an organisational level. Educators are willing to adapt and enhance their physical courses with online learning to form blended learning arrangements but lack the expertise, the technological skills and already available and accessible content to start their efforts with. Online collaborative learning is one very promising path to engage in blended learning, as it is a core element to teach as well as assess Twenty-First Century Skills, formulated by the OECD and its Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This situation involves numerous obstacles for higher education educators. The educators, who gained expertise during intensive research in the field of online and blended learning are having difficulties conveying their expertise to other interested parties. There is a lack of international cross-institutional initiative to implement online and blended learning in a systematic and widely accessible manner.   by developing OER online course modules for online collaborative learning and teaching, structured along the DigCompEdu framework. These courses will give educators the expertise to engage in blended learning activities at their institutions. Furthermore, the online course modules aim to generate OER content with the participants. This ensures that educators do not only gain expertise in the courses but also have the possibility to apply their gain knowledge and develop OER content themselves. This OER content is published with the online course modules and represents a self-sustaining OER pool for online collaborative learning and teaching methods.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;The main objective of OER-CODEX is to develop OER course modules, conveying digital teaching and learning methods of online collaborative learning in a blended learning context for educators in higher education (HE), aiming to increase the capacity and readiness of  HE institutions to manage an effective shift towards digital education. This means the digital teaching and learning methods are not seen as a standalone implementation but a modern and much needed addition to the physical learning scenarios. Furthermore, the digital teaching and learning methods are seen in the context of online collaborative learning, as this type of learning is an effective as well as specific learning content independent method to convey Twenty-First Century Skills, as formulated by the OECD and is therefore applicable in all kinds of learning scenarios where collaborative problem solving is imaginable. These course modules aim to convey digital pedagogy competencies and expertise in the use of digital tools for educators, including accessible and assistive technologies and the creation and innovative use of digital education content. In detail, the course modules are structured along the areas of the DigCompEdu framework and therefore support the strategic effort to develop digital education competencies in HE institutions. These course modules shall stimulate innovative learning and teaching practices by giving educators OER course modules in which they gain expertise and experience in implementing online collaborative learning but also generate OER content suitable of online collaborative learning with which they can start from and adapt for their courses. Furthermore, a methodology will be developed, which describes how to design OER course modules so that OER content can be generated within these courses, thereby building self-sustaining OER resource pool as more experienced educators can add their course modules to this OER collection.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;The project consortium will first collaboratively develop a methodology for developing OER online course modules with the integrated element of OER content generation with the participants. This methodology will be presented and communicated in a first multiplier event. The primary target group for this event will be educators already experienced in digital education from associated partners, willing to convey their expertise to other educators. This methodology will give these educators guidance on how to develop their own OER online course modules, which adds to the envisioned OER pool for online and blended learning methods and techniques. The piloting of the developed course modules will give this project the possibility to reach a broader audience and will generate a first set of OER content, as proposed in the methodology. Furthermore, the piloting is an important part for quality assurance of the developed online course modules. Lastly, the online course modules as well as the OER content will be published on an OER platform, for all interested educators to access, adapt and extend.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;The project will have three main project result types.

Within EU funded projects, internationalization at large has been covered by different projects embracing European concepts like Bologna system, ECTS, internationalization of curriculum and cross-cultural issues within a multi-diversity paradigm. Though IaH is a relatively recent concept, it has already been embraced widely, particularly in northern and western Europe. IaH aims to bring internationalisation to all students through the home curriculum. It is therefore primarily about teaching and learning, which implies that lecturers are increasingly becoming prominent players in internationalisation. After all, they are the ones who create learning environments with international and intercultural dimensions. The project thus attempts to develop University Strategy on IoHE and Research and individual Action plans for IaH in 12 PCHEIs after exploring the different EU models available for IaH. A common terminology around the concept of IaH will be needed as well.

Different project reports and academic papers published in the past five years have pointed to several interconnected barriers hindering social innovation initiatives. Drawing specifically on the outcomes of three projects that members of this consortium have participated in – SI-DRIVE,  SIC,  and Labs for Social Innovation  – we highlight the following challenges that merit critical attention:\\n1. Social innovation lacks access to finance, scaling models, and qualified personnel and is not applied enough.\\n2. Social innovators act in silos and are not integrated into the wider innovation ecosystems. \\n3. Social innovation toolkits are plentiful, but there is a lack of records about the tools’ effectiveness and pertinence. \\nThe CHESS project tackles the above challenges head-on by designing, implementing and testing a “Social Innovation Action manual” in four locally specific contexts.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 353410.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}], 'IT_UNISS': [{'id': 'fct_________::bc251a0234453b7acfafb9ddb8880437', 'code': '2023.12085.PEX', 'acronym': 'EpiFoWa', 'title': 'An Epistemology for Food Waste.

However, approximately one-third of the food produced is wasted, amounting to about 930 million tons annually. This wastage plays a significant role in climate change, with some estimates suggesting that if food waste were a country, it would rank as the third-largest global emitter of greenhouse gases. Indeed, reducing and effectively managing food waste stands as a crucial objective within the framework of the UN 2030 Agenda (Goal 12.3). Still, interdisciplinary literature remarks two notable obstacles to accomplish that goal: flawed extant definitions that fall short to really identify food waste and the absence of a universally applicable and consistent set of criteria for defining food waste. Such a definition would play a crucial role in underpinning measurements of the economic and environmental impacts of food waste. Additionally, if consumers and agencies adopt, as often happen, different definitions of food waste that might undermine attempts to reduce or revise wasteful behaviors. But how can such a definition be established? Who possesses the suitable knowledge? Who should have the epistemic authority and how to ascertain their expertise? While these questions have sparked debate among scholars across various disciplines, it is somewhat surprising that philosophy has only played a marginal role in addressing them. This limited interest is puzzling, given that addressing the epistemological foundation of relevant piece of knowledge should arguably be one of philosophy fundamental missions. This FCT Exploratory Research Project endeavors to fill this gap deploying philosophical tools for grounding and assessing the epistemology of food waste. However, philosophers may still think that defining food waste requires only a trivial expertise. This is because answering questions like “what is food waste?” and “is this food waste?” could appear to demand basic skills. However, these questions conceal a host of complexities that warrant deeper exploration: should the disposal of food to increase its market value be considered wasteful?, does overconsumption or overprovisioning qualify as food waste?, what properties does an observer detect when categorizing an item as wasted?, are these properties intrinsic or relational? To offer consistent and robust answers to these and cognate questions, this project aims at laying down a comprehensive food waste epistemology, by pursuing three objectives.\\nObjective 1. Defining the Expertise on Food Waste. This part will explore what skills and expertise should be required to define food waste, following the guiding hypothesis that this expertise does not rest only on quantitative and scientific kind of knowledge, but it requires also everyday experiences and traditional ecological knowledge.\\nObjective 2. Integrating the Normative Dimensions in Food Waste Epistemology . Empirical surveys offer substantial evidence that people tend to condemn food waste. Asking “what is food waste,” thus, not only requires a descriptive account of its scope, but also involves a normative inquiry, which still deserves to be pursued.\\nObjective 3. Assessing the Relation between Political Authority and the Epistemology of Food Waste: Debates concerning the definition of food waste tend to be highly specialized, while the management and the social and economic consequences of wasting food usually involve ordinary people’s daily lives. This, arguably, raises different kinds of political questions. On the one hand, how to assess whether a definition of food waste complies with the political principles that the community at stake endorses and, on the other hand, whether stakeholders should actively participate in negotiating the definition, for example, through citizen science or deliberative democracy.\\nThese three objectives are pursued by scholars, inside and outside philosophy, who rarely interact with each other. Thus, the main challenges of the project are, first, to pave the way for a new research area in philosophy and, second, to build a serious theoretical bridge between scholarships traditionally separated in order to provide food waste studies with a serious epistemological foundation. Tente perguntar a alguém se desperdiçar comida é moralmente aceitável e, muito provavelmente, eles expressarão a opinião de que não, desperdiçar comida é moralmente errado e deve ser evitado ou, na falta disso, moralmente condenado. No entanto, aproximadamente um terço dos alimentos produzidos é desperdiçado, totalizando cerca de 930 milhões de toneladas anualmente. Esse desperdício desempenha um papel significativo nas mudanças climáticas, com algumas estimativas sugerindo que, se o desperdício de alimentos fosse um país, ele seria classificado como o terceiro maior emissor global de gases de efeito estufa. De fato, a redução e a gestão eficaz do desperdício de alimentos são objetivos cruciais dentro do quadro da Agenda 2030 da ONU (Objetivo 12.3).\\nNo entanto, a literatura interdisciplinar destaca dois obstáculos notáveis para alcançar esse objetivo: definições existentes falhas que não conseguem realmente identificar o desperdício de alimentos e a ausência de um conjunto universalmente aplicável e consistente de critérios para definir o desperdício de alimentos. Essa definição desempenharia um papel crucial no suporte às medições dos impactos econômicos e ambientais do desperdício de alimentos. Além disso, se consumidores e agências adotarem, como frequentemente ocorre, definições diferentes de desperdício de alimentos, isso pode minar tentativas de reduzir ou revisar comportamentos desperdiçadores.\\nMas como pode ser estabelecida tal definição? Quem possui o conhecimento adequado? Quem deveria ter a autoridade epistêmica e como garantir sua expertise? Embora essas perguntas tenham provocado debate entre estudiosos de diversas disciplinas, é surpreendente que a filosofia tenha desempenhado apenas um papel marginal ao abordá-las. Esse interesse limitado é intrigante, dado que abordar os fundamentos epistemológicos de uma parte relevante do conhecimento deveria ser, arguivelmente, uma das missões fundamentais da filosofia.\\nEste Projeto de Pesquisa Exploratória da FCT busca preencher essa lacuna, utilizando ferramentas filosóficas para fundamentar e avaliar a epistemologia do desperdício de alimentos. No entanto, os filósofos podem ainda considerar que definir o desperdício de alimentos requer apenas uma expertise trivial. Isso porque responder a perguntas como \"o que é desperdício de alimentos?\" e \"isso é desperdício de alimentos?\" pode parecer exigir habilidades básicas. No entanto, essas perguntas escondem uma série de complexidades que merecem uma exploração mais profunda: deveria o descarte de alimentos para aumentar seu valor de mercado ser considerado desperdício? O excesso de consumo ou superprovisão qualifica como desperdício de alimentos? Que propriedades um observador detecta ao categorizar um item como desperdiçado? Essas propriedades são intrínsecas ou relacionais? Para oferecer respostas consistentes e robustas a essas e outras perguntas correlatas, este projeto visa estabelecer uma epistemologia abrangente do desperdício de alimentos, perseguindo três objetivos.\\nObjetivo 1. Definir a Expertise em Desperdício de Alimentos: Esta parte explorará quais habilidades e conhecimentos devem ser exigidos para definir o desperdício de alimentos, seguindo a hipótese orientadora de que essa expertise não repousa apenas em conhecimentos quantitativos e científicos, mas também requer experiências cotidianas e conhecimento ecológico tradicional.\\nObjetivo 2. Integrar as Dimensões Normativas na Epistemologia do Desperdício de Alimentos: Pesquisas empíricas oferecem evidências substanciais de que as pessoas tendem a condenar o desperdício de alimentos. Perguntar \"o que é desperdício de alimentos\", portanto, não apenas exige uma descrição de sua abrangência, mas também envolve uma investigação normativa que ainda merece ser explorada.\\nObjetivo 3. Avaliar a Relação entre Autoridade Política e a Epistemologia do Desperdício de Alimentos: Os debates sobre a definição do desperdício de alimentos tendem a ser altamente especializados, enquanto a gestão e as consequências sociais e econômicas do desperdício de alimentos geralmente envolvem as vidas diárias das pessoas comuns. Isso, arguivelmente, levanta diferentes tipos de questões políticas. De um lado, como avaliar se uma definição de desperdício de alimentos está de acordo com os princípios políticos que a comunidade em questão endossa, e, por outro lado, se os interessados devem participar ativamente na negociação da definição, por exemplo, por meio da ciência cidadã ou da democracia deliberativa.\\nEsses três objetivos são perseguidos por estudiosos dentro e fora da filosofia, que raramente interagem entre si. Assim, os principais desafios do projeto são, primeiro, abrir caminho para uma nova área de pesquisa em filosofia e, segundo, construir uma ponte teórica séria entre bolsas de estudo tradicionalmente separadas, a fim de fornecer estudos sobre o desperdício de alimentos com uma base epistemológica sólida.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 50000.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::4dded3056bc1373d5e1f5e9057f4ca45', 'code': '780788', 'acronym': 'ALOHA', 'title': 'software framework for runtime-Adaptive and secure deep Learning On Heterogeneous Architectures', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2018-01-01', 'endDate': '2021-06-30', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-ICT-2017-1', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': ['Customised and low energy computing (including Low power processor technologies)'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are an extremely promising instrument in artificial intelligence, achieving very high performance in numerous recognition, identification, and classification tasks. To foster their pervasive adoption in a vast scope of new applications and markets, a step forward is needed towards the implementation of the on-line classification task (called inference) on low-power embedded systems, enabling a shift to the edge computing paradigm. Nevertheless, when DL is moved at the edge, severe performance requirements must coexist with tight constraints in terms of power/energy consumption, posing the need for parallel and energy-efficient heterogeneous computing platforms. Unfortunately, programming for this kind of architectures requires advanced skills and significant effort, also considering that DL algorithms are designed to improve precision, without considering the limitations of the device that will execute the inference. Thus, the deployment of DL algorithms on heterogeneous architectures is often unaffordable for SMEs and midcaps without adequate support from software development tools. \\nThe main goal of ALOHA is to facilitate implementation of DL on heterogeneous low-energy computing platforms.

Macroalgal forests enhance coastal primary productivity, maintain high biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, including habitat for commercial target species. This ecosystem is affected by multiple human pressures leading to contrasting responses. Overfishing may impact macroalgal forests by reducing predatory fish numbers: this results in the loss of predator control on herbivores (sea urchins), and in their uncontrolled proliferation, with consequent loss of habitat structure. In contrast, sea urchin overharvesting can lead to local population collapses. In the Mediterranean Sea, both sea urchins and fish constitute locally important target species for small-scale fisheries. Uncoordinated management can result in overfishing of either or both resources, and/or in overgrazing of macroalgae, leading to habitat and biodiversity loss and to permanent regime shifts. Although this situation is common in coastal systems, there are hardly any examples of effective coordinated management of fisheries and habitats. MUrFor sets out firstly to improve our understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics and their relationship to environmental variability in the context of alternative stable states. The objective is to identify critical thresholds leading to irreversible regime shifts on the habitat (overgrazing), the resource (overharvesting), and the fishery (economic sustainability). This will be achieved through a multi-modelling approach based on a suite of single-species, multi-species, ecosystem, economic and bio-economic models, which account for multispecies dynamics and socio-economic analyses of relevant scenarios emerging from stakeholders. Models will be informed by tailored in-situ experiments and stakeholder engagement exercises. Study areas will be based on two contrasting regional conditions: Catalonia (Spain), where the reduction of seabreams is leading to widespread barrens; and Sardinia (Italy), where intensive sea urchin harvesting has resulted in the collapse of local populations and of the related fisheries. These contrasting situations will serve as a benchmark to assess how effective ecosystem-based management of the fisheries and the habitats, tailored to local specificities, may deliver reasonable trade-offs between conservation and exploitation. Through active stakeholder engagement, the project will develop a toolbox to co-design an actionable research/management program for both marine forest conservation and sustainable sea urchin fishery.

Literature on urbanization in China focuses mainly on traditional large metropolitan or industrial cities in the center with Han majority population, and examines either the structural or the subjective features of urban development. The complex dynamics of urbanization and power relations in the new cities in the periphery remain understudied. The project fills this knowledge gap, by exploring how urbanization intersects with tourism growth and in-migration and affects ethnic relations in Jinghong, a fast-growing city in China’s south-western borderlands. In Jinghong, the Han, China’s ethnic majority, have become the city’s drivers of urban and economic development, competing over land, resources and political power with long-term Dai/Tai minority ethnic residents. Unconventionally drawing on methods of Anthropology, Urban Planning, Architecture, Urban Geography, and Sociology, this pioneering project aims at producing a theoretically and empirically innovative analysis that combines structural, socio-economic, and political examination with an investigation of subjective and experiential aspects of urbanization, highlighting conflicts, mindsets, and prejudices in the day-to-day urban interactions between Han majority and ethnic minority citizens and the state. \\n\\nI expect that the development of this project will profoundly impact my career.

However, despite the efforts to maintain outstanding reproductive performance, the reproductive failures are still considerable.

Some studies have indicated that the use of polyunsatures fatty acids (PUFAS) like omega-3 have a positve effects on human and animal health. Nowadays, the effects of diets rich in PUFAS omega-3 (PUFASn-3) on reproductive physiology have been studied assensing the follicular function, ovulation rate and oocyte quality. In addition, there is scarce information about of the mechanism and/or effectiveness of PUFASn-3 during peri-implantational period in mammals. However the outcomes obtained have been controversiel and non-conclusive, justifying the necesity to perform futher studies. Thus, the combined use of morphologic studies, hormonal assays, genomics and proteomics procedures and embryo recover/transfer technologies could be suitable methodologies to evaluate the effects of PUFASn-3 during peri-implantational period. Also, these tools could evaluate the maternal/endometrial signal (e.g: receptors expression) and gene embryonic expressions during this period. In consequence, these studies could assess the effectiveness of PUFASn-3 on maternal and/or embryo’s level. The results obtained, will contribute to enhance the productivity in animal production system. Furthermore, the use of ovine species has been a classical experimental model in human medical studies.

The potential of SI to change the energy model of European farming is huge as irrigation demands large amounts of energy for pumping water to crops. Alongside a €4 bn energy bill, the current fossil-fuel based energy model of irrigation also has a high environmental cost; it produces 16 million tons of CO2 every year, approximately 15% of the EU’s total CO2 emissions from agriculture.

Therefore, it features prominently in many political initiatives such as the EU Green Deal and the Bonn Challenge. Yet, the ongoing increase in biotic and abiotic stress driven by CC puts forests under threat. In the face of CC, adaptation and mitigation by forests are ultimately linked, because the ability of forests to sequester carbon (C) in the long run depends on the ability of trees to cope with multiple stresses. A growing body of evidence suggests that mixed forest plantations, i.e., plantations where several tree species are mixed, are more efficient in sequestrating C, while better coping with CC-related stress. Mixed plantations thus represent an opportunity for an important nature-based solution for CC mitigation and adaptation. However, monocultures still dominate the world?s forest plantations. The reasons for the apparent resistance to mixed plantations among landowners and stakeholders need to be identified and addressed in future forest policies to promote the large-scale expansion of more CC-resilient mixed forest plantations. One of the possible factors that may have prevented the expansion of mixed plantations at large scales is insufficient scientific evidence for practitioners and policy-makers. Using a global network of forest biodiversity experiments (TreeDivNet), we will provide a mechanistic understanding of how tree diversity, species identities and management (thinning and fertilization) influence both the potential of mixed forest plantations to mitigate (C sequestration) and adapt (drought and herbivory resilience) to CC, in a win-win approach. In addition, we will translate this knowledge into guidelines that can be widely adopted by practitioners and policy-makers. The TreeDivNet network comprises 26 experiments spread across the globe, with ca. 1.2M planted trees. All these experiments were based on a common, statistically sound design that allows detection of causal relationships between tree diversity, management and forest ecosystem functioning (incl. C sequestration). The functional and mechanistic focus of MixForChange and the contrasting environmental contexts embedded in the network will allow us to scale-up our findings beyond case studies to provide evidence-based guidelines for mixed plantation management in a broad range of environments. Moreover, MixForChange will analyse in a common framework, and at unprecedented scale, synergies and trade-offs between the CC mitigation and adaptation potential of mixed plantations and the fulfilment of stakeholders? objectives. The societal impact of MixForChange will be ensured by a strong focus on knowledge transfer and capacity-building at all levels of management and governance.

In recent years, with the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology, much emphasis has been placed on nanomaterials as a tool in the remediation of water contamination, particularly attributed to toxic metal contamination (e.g., As, Cd, Mn, Pb), due to their high specific surface area and greater reactivity.\\nSuperficial and groundwater systems provide a significant amount of freshwater for drinking, industrial use, and agriculture worldwide. These complex environments play a significant ecological role and provide numerous ecosystems, such as food production, soil protection, and climate regulation. With the effects of global change, the significance of water supply should be emphasized, particularly in Mediterranean areas and Portugal. The expected changes in rainfall patterns and temperature increases will have a major impact on water management and soil structure, where these predicted disturbances will be added to an already precarious fresh-saltwater balance. In rice fields, the quality of the water used for irrigation is crucial for crop development and soil conservation, but, at the same time, there is concern about the potential mixing of water from paddy fields with local aquifer systems and, in our case study, with the River Tagus and its tributaries.\\nOne of the problems associated with rice plantations is that, in many rural areas, drinking and domestic water supplies are drawn from shallow aquifers under agricultural land, and the quality of these water resources can be affected by the use of agrochemicals. In addition to this anthropogenic pollution, the bioaccumulation of toxic elements in rice fields is a major environmental concern, as rice is the basic food for billions of people.\\nThe uptake of toxic and trace elements in rice is mainly due to their interaction with the soil-water system. In this proposal, our main concern is the release of these toxic metals into water systems, like \\xa0surface water in rice fields, either through the possible linkage to groundwaters, or mixing with the waters of the Tagus River or its tributaries. Among the pollutants, the increase of As in water systems is of great concern to the WHO, where the maximum limit has been reduced from 50 µg/L to 10 µg/L since 2003.\\nIn this proposal, a different approach to remove the toxic metals present in the water systems will be tested for the first time in the rice fields of Portugal, using NPs ( iron chelatin-type NPs ). NPs, due to their large surface area and selectivity, have emerged as an alternative for the adsorption of water contaminants. This methodology will be tested in COTArroz rice fields, where water and soil samples will be collected and analyzed. In the C2TN/IST facilities using the real chemical data modelling and synthesis\\xa0 of \\xa0superparamagnetic iron NPs, naked and coated with chelatins will be carried out. These iron NPs, present a prime characteristics for remediating arsenic and heavy metals in rice fields water. In the light of the chemical speciation models, the necessary adjustments will be made to the synthesis of these NPs, in order to obtain high capacity for absorbing As.\\nArsenium remediation within the water rice fields will be tested with: extraction, adsorption regeneration and reuse of the NPs , to determine the best conditions for the adsorption of As(III) ions. Besides, the regeneration and life cycle assessments of the adsorbents will be performed. This possibility of reuse will contribute to reducing the economic burden associated with water treatment processes\\nOur proposal is to test the efficiency of iron chelatin-type NPs in removing As and other toxic metals present in rice field water (COTArroz) along the rice development until it is harvested, i.e. to study the chemical evolution of water in toxic metals along the growing of rice, using the water composition of COTArroz fields as a laboratory analogue.\\nThe final objective of the project is to test the efficiency of our NPs (magnetic nanoparticles) as an efficient adsorbent of toxic metals in water systems (rice fields, surface water and groundwater), with the main aim of increasing environmental sustainability through a definitive reduction in the arsenic content of the water samples below the WHO limit for drinking water. The rice fields will be used as a laboratory analogue to test this approach for the first time in Portugal, from the laboratory to the efficacy in the rice fields and the final reuse of the NPs. O plano de investigação proposto ARSENIX abrange diversos áreas científicas, desde a hidrogeologia até à modelação\\xa0química e síntese, com o objetivo comum de\\xa0 contribuir para a remediação e sustentabilidade dos recursos hídricos, com ênfase nas atividades em campos de arroz, visando uma melhor qualidade do meio ambiente, com o desenvolvimento de novas abordagens utilizando nanopartículas de ferro (NPs). Os avanços da nanociência e da nanotecnologia, têm dado origem ao desenvolvimento de nanomateriais usados como uma ferramenta na remediação da contaminação da água, especialmente relacionada à presença de metais tóxicos (por exemplo, As, Cd, Mn, Pb), devido à sua elevada\\xa0área de superfície específica e maior reatividade.\\nOs sistemas de águas superficiais e subterrâneas fornecem uma quantidade significativa de água doce para consumo, utilização industrial e agricultura em todo o mundo. Estes ambientes complexos desempenham um papel ecológico significativo e proporcionam numerosos ecossistemas, como a produção de alimentos, a proteção dos solos e a regulação do clima. Com os efeitos das alterações globais, a importância do abastecimento de água deve ser realçada, particularmente nas zonas mediterrânicas e em Portugal. As alterações previstas nos padrões de precipitação e o aumento da temperatura terão no futuro um grande impacto na gestão da água e na estrutura do solo, onde estas perturbações previstas se unirão a um equilíbrio já precário entre água doce e água salgada. Nos arrozais, a qualidade da água utilizada na rega é crucial para o desenvolvimento das culturas e para a conservação do solo, mas, ao mesmo tempo, existe a preocupação da potencial mistura da água dos arrozais com os sistemas aquíferos locais e, no nosso caso de estudo, com o rio Tejo e seus afluentes.\\nUm dos problemas associados às plantações de arroz prende-se que, em muitas zonas rurais, com o abastecimento de água potável e doméstica ser\\xa0\\xa0feito a partir de aquíferos pouco profundos sob os terrenos agrícolas, e a qualidade destes recursos hídricos poder ser afetada pela utilização de agroquímicos. Para além desta poluição antropogénica, a bioacumulação de elementos tóxicos nos campos de arroz é uma preocupação ambiental importante, uma vez que o arroz é o alimento básico de milhares de milhões de pessoas.\\nA absorção de elementos tóxicos e vestigiais no arroz deve-se principalmente à sua interação com o sistema solo-água. Nesta proposta, a principal preocupação é a libertação destes metais tóxicos para os sistemas hídricos, como as águas superficiais dos arrozais, quer através da possível ligação às águas subterrâneas, quer através da mistura com as águas do rio Tejo ou dos seus afluentes. Entre os poluentes, o aumento de As nos sistemas hídricos é motivo de grande preocupação para a OMS, onde o limite máximo foi reduzido de 50 µg/L para 10 µg/L desde 2003.\\nNesta proposta, será testada pela primeira vez uma abordagem diferente para remover os metais tóxicos presentes nos sistemas de água nos campos de arroz de Portugal, utilizando NPs (NPs do tipo quelatina de ferro).. Esta metodologia será testada nos campos de arroz do COTArroz, onde serão analisadas amostras de água e de solo. Nas instalações do C2TN/IST, utilizando os dados químicos reais, será efetuada a modelação e síntese de NPs de ferro super-paramagnéticas, nuas (SP) e revestidas com quelatinas (SP@GSH). Estas NPs apresentam características magnéticas privilegiadas para a remediação do arsénio e dos metais pesados na água dos arrozais. À luz dos modelos de especiação química, serão feitos os ajustes necessários à síntese destas NPs, de modo a obter uma elevada capacidade de absorção de As.\\nA remediação do arsénio na água dos arrozais será testada com: extração, regeneração por adsorção e reutilização das NPs, para determinar as melhores condições para a adsorção de iões As(III). Além disso, serão efetuadas avaliações da regeneração e do ciclo de vida dos adsorventes. Esta possibilidade de reutilização contribuirá para reduzir os encargos económicos associados aos processos de tratamento da água\\nSerá testada a eficiência das SP e SP@GSH na remoção de As e outros metais tóxicos presentes na água dos campos de arroz (COTArroz) ao longo do desenvolvimento da planta até à sua colheita, e\\xa0 avaliada a evolução química da água em metais tóxicos ao longo do crescimento do arroz, utilizando a composição da água dos campos de COTArroz como análogo laboratorial.\\nO objetivo final do projeto é testar a eficácia das nossas NPs como adsorvente eficiente de metais tóxicos em sistemas hídricos (arrozais, águas superficiais e subterrâneas), para aumentar a sustentabilidade ambiental através de uma redução definitiva do teor de arsénio das amostras de água abaixo do limite da OMS para a água potável. Os campos de arroz serão utilizados como um laboratório análogo para testar esta abordagem pela primeira vez em Portugal, desde o laboratório até à eficácia nos campos de arroz e à reutilização final das NPs.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 49789.4}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::4359e9094daa123ed79c714708010919', 'code': '640771', 'acronym': 'MASLOWATEN', 'title': 'MArket uptake of an innovative irrigation Solution based on LOW WATer-ENergy consumption', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2015-09-01', 'endDate': '2018-08-31', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-WATER-2014-two-stage', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': ['First application and market replication'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The world of irrigation requires innovative solutions, less water and energy dependant.

We used this as a starting point to create our projetc STET we saw as a opportunity to raise awareness about sustainable tourism to development among students, persons in public and private sectors, decision-makers and the public, while mobilizing all stakeholders to work together in making tourism a catalyst for positive change.Within this global objective, the 5 partners of this project worked together to create two high quality training modules, using up to date digital technologies, and answering the needs of skill and knowledge development of the youth and future labour force in the growing economy of Tourism, especially in Slow Tourism and E-tourism, two main growth factor of the tourism sector. To enhance the possibility for all satkeholders to meet up around these two subjects we also created a forum on our online platform to give the possibility to all interested people to exchange their point of views and meet together. This platform, with the two online MOOC's about Slow Tourism and E-tourism, the forum and the general project information can be found on the supporting interactive web platform at: www.slowtourismacademy.com.To realise these project outputs two training organisation, two universities and a cluster from France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece have been working together for the last two years.During the project we associated companies (Kalkin, American Farmschool, Florie Thielin, Reoviz) and institutions ( Office de tourisme Sancy) as consultative experts. The goal of this association is to allow the trainings to be designed by professionals of pedagogy (universities and training centers) and linked to on-field experience through consulting companies and regional institutions. To do so we met with the stakeholders making the slow-tourism and e-tourism, either pratictioners or professionanle and made them talk aboit their experience and expertiese in this field trought videos integrated into the final Moocs.Our project is also inscribed in a logic of innovative and open practices and digital technologies by using the most advances Moodle and wordpress integrations. These technologies are open source and easy to maintain alive on a long period as they can be updated easily.The main final results are two MOOCs on Slow Tourism and E-Tourism, the creation of a network and charter on Slow Tourism as well as the creation of an online platform serving three purposes : dissemination of project results, e-learning platform and forum for all stakeholders of Slow tourism, thus allowing not only exchanges of information and updates to be used in the MOOCs but fostering the creation of new synergies and new exemplary Slow initiatives in tourism destinations.The impacts expected from the MOOC's and the Forum are diverse : from more knowledge on the topics for students as well as professors and companies, to improving entrepreneuship and facilitating the process for the next generation to implement slow tourism activities and digital tools in tourism in a close future.The project results target students and professors of Higher Education as well as vocational training and companies through lifelong learning and network animation, but also all tourism stakeholders, from regional to international networks and regional or national elected representatives in charge of Tourism development schemes. The expected impact at long term is a deep change in the conception of Tourism activities in order to reduce in environmental and societal risks and at the same time increase its positive environmental and societal impact. At the end of the project we succeede to create 2 Moocs but then etwork stays quite challenging, we had to experience that it will take time to implement on long term such a change. But we could see in all partner countries the raising interest and changes going step by step towards the slow-tourism and the e-tourism integration. We can see that there will be a network in the near futur as the rising number of posiitve initiatives on slow-tourismm and e-tourism will reenforce a network about theses topics. These 2 topics really are new trends and even going further new deep preoccupations of citizens in all europe: in terms of how they travel but also how they eat and consume.The activities which will be maintained after the end of the EU fundings are concentrated on the platform www.slowtourismacademy.com. The two developped MOOC's will stay active on the platform as well as the forum and the community. The professors fo Madeira and Palma, who developped the two courses will update the content if needed or if they feel to improove them.

This problem is addressed by using advanced Data Assimilation (DA) techniques, which play an important role in current numerical weather prediction and is currently at the forefront of atmospheric and oceanic sciences research. However, although using the most current sophisticated DA algorithms, the estimation of the atmosphere is not accurate enough to improve the predictability of hazardous weather events, mainly because their linear and Gaussian underlying assumptions.

Virtual Mobility (VM) has a great potential to contribute to the internationalisation, innovation and inclusion in HE. While it is feasible to encourage outward and inward student and faculty mobility in HE, the main limitations are the high costs, socio-economic, political and health-related issues. These barriers can be dramatically reduced by adding the virtual component to mobility, thus making mobility accessible to all.   Yet, despite numerous Virtual Mobility initiatives and projects in the past years, the uptake of Virtual Mobility in HE is still low and the possibilities of VM including Virtual Internships/Placements unknown to many educators and students.   Virtual Mobility can develop its potential, provided HE leaders, educators, students and other relevant stakeholders, such as International Offices, know about and can/want to use the opportunities of VM. This means HE institutions, educators and students need the necessary skills, confidence and readiness to initiate and implement VM Actions. The aim of this project is to enhance the VM readiness of HE institutions, educators and students through achievement, assessment and recognition of Virtual Mobility Skills.  The openVM project addresses the need of creating accessible opportunities for achievement of Virtual Mobility Skills to ensure higher uptake of Virtual Mobility in HE in Europe, by supporting HE institutions, educators and students in acquiring, assessing and recognising Virtual Mobility Skills, i. e. key competencies needed to successfully design, implement and participate in VM actions.   OBJECTIVES The openVM project aims at promoting and scaling-up VM in HE in Europe through achievement, assessment and recognition of Virtual Mobility Skills of HE educators and students in line with the Bologna and Open Education principles. The key objectives of the openVM project are:  1. To enhance the uptake of VM in HE by improving VM Skills and in consequence the readiness for VM in HE. 2. To improve the achievement and recognition of VM Skills of HE institutions, educators and students.  3. To create a European VM Learning Hub for achievement, assessment and recognition of VM Skills as a central reference point. 4. To develop a set of innovative tools and methods to enhance achievement, assessment and recognition of VM Skills. 5. To provide sustainable infrastructure, resources and guidelines for enhancement of VM Skills, design and implementation of VM in HE in Europe. 6. To provide evidence about how assessment and credentialing of VM Skills contributes to the uptake VM.  APPROACH/INNOVATION To achieve this, openVM applies the principles of Open Education to promote achievement, assessment and recognition of VM Skills. Both VM and OE aim to enhance participation in international knowledge flows, use of digital media, improve teaching and learning by setting international benchmarks, attract and keep talents for the economy and research systems, innovate and build capacity.   Key innovations in openVM are: + Online, Open &amp; Flexible Higher Education approach to promoting the achievement, assessment and credentialing of VM Skills + Innovative pedagogies for achievement of VM Skills, such as Open Learning by Design and Crowd Creation of OERs and MOOCs  + Innovative approaches/technologies for assessment and recognition of VM Skills: Evidence-based assessment, Open Credentials (Open Badges, Blockcerts), semantic/machine-readable description of VM Skills with links to competency frameworks + Engaging and effective learner experience in a Personal Learning Environment making use of gamification designs  OUTCOMES The main outcomes of the project are: O1: Conceptual Framework and Guidelines for achievement, assessment and recognition of VM Skills in HE O2: Virtual Mobility Learning Hub as a central reference point for VM Skills in Europe O3: Semantic Competency Directory and Matching Tool as Smart Tools supporting learning, assessment and recognition of VM skills O4: E-Assessment Concept and Tool for innovative, open and evidence-based assessment of VM Skills O5: Open Credentials and Gamification for recognition of VM Skills and engaging/effective learner experience O6: OER, MOOC and Pilots for innovative pedagogies for achievement of VM Skills and validation O7: Quality, Dissemination, Sustainability for quality-assurance, broad outreach and sustainability of project results   EXPECTED IMPACT + Increased awareness of Virtual Mobility in HE in Europe + Established Leadership in assessment and recognition of VM Skills + Increased readiness and confidence of educators and students to participate in and implement VM  + Sustainable Learning Hub for the continuous development, assessment and recognition of VM Skills  + Enhanced transparency about the distribution and level of VM Skills in HE in Europe\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 416712.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::7502f390482d1b0e3aae1201c2105d1f', 'code': '954912', 'acronym': 'S-TEAM', 'title': 'NIGHT SPANISH TEAM', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2020-06-01', 'endDate': '2021-05-31', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-MSCA-NIGHT-2020', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': [\"European Researchers' Night\"], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The scientific and technological development has a great influence in how our societies make progress, together with other social factors such as politics or economics.

We believe that the participation of this educational institution, with its previous experience in intergenerational relations and its high interest in continuous improvement, enriched the project. In addition, the participation of the two European universities mentioned, with their extensive experience and institutional capacity, complemented the research experience of the SACHI2 project. Other institution that are involved in SACHI2 has been demostrated an higher experience on gerontology.The activities were divided into:  Preparation workshops for seniors; sessions at schools; evaluation and feedback collecting; dissemination and information at different  levels; the seniors-volunteers were also engaged in other, apart from sessions, school activities, as exhibitions, competitions, celebrations; additionally, we have engaged other groups and seniors  organizations in order to share the experiences and convince to engage in intergenerational learning programs.This project and the tested approaches has proved to be effective in increasing intergenerational interaction, while at the same time destroying prejudices and stereotypes regarding aging, both on the part of the children in relation to the elderly, and the older ones in relation to themselves.First of all, the schools realized, it is possible and very necessary to arrange intergenerational learning opportunities; it is important to show, as a result, the intergenerational learning at schools can be professionally prepared and conducted, respecting the schools’ daily life and curriculum as well as delivering interesting content, methods used during the sessions, being a partner for teachers and schools’ staff.

Europe enterprises are trying to bounce back from the negative impacts caused by the multiple lockdowns, confinement restrictions, loss of productivity, just to name a few factors. To survive this economic, health and social crisis, enterprises must display organisational resilience, supported by adaptive management systems. With the rise of global warming, the probability of another pandemic, major migration patterns (and others), it’s a case of knowing how to deal with the next crisis (not IF there will be a next crisis). Nevertheless, organisations face adversities daily and the way they respond to such adversities can make the organisation fragile (if acting rigidly) or flexible (if acting through a set of skills that promote the efficiency and growth of the organisation) (Sutcliffe &amp; Vogus, 2003).Organisational resilience is the ability of organisations to face adversity in such a way that generates a response that allows the bouncing back and activation of coping mechanisms, the achievement of a healthy/positive adaptation, plus the development of new capabilities and the expansion of skills that allow the exploration of opportunities and the construction of skills to deal with future adversities (Coutu, 2002). This is achieved by two components: a) the individual resilience of the organisation workforce (when used collectively) and b) the systemic resilience of the organization processes (system capacity) (Irigaray, Paiva, &amp; Goldschmidt, 2017).Resilient organisations have common traits: they exhibit excess/redundant capacity, flexibility, reliability, trustworthiness, respect and robustness (Denhardt &amp; Denhardt, 2010, p. 338).Enterprises face the negative impacts of COVID19 restrictions, decreased revenues, liquidity problems, temporary or permanent lay-off solutions and overall survival possibility.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;The FENIX project aims to contribute to fostering the resilience of European enterprises and their workers, through the development of an innovative gamified training experience, a guideline to support the implementation of systemic Resilience practices within enterprises and an online crash course on Adaptative Management.

This represents a major bottleneck for energy efficient, scalable and portable AI systems. Reducing the energy consumption of the massively dense interconnects in existing CPUs needed to emulate complex brain functions is a major challenge. ChipAI aims at developing a nanoscale photonics-enabled technology capable of deliver compact, high-bandwidth and energy efficiency CPUs using optically interconnected spiking neuron-like sources and detectors. ChipAI will pursue its main goal through the exploitation of Resonant Tunnelling (RT) semiconductor nanostructures embedded in sub-wavelength metal cavities, with dimensions 100 times smaller over conventional devices, for efficient light confinement, emission and detection. Key elements developed are non-linear RT nanoscale lasers, LEDs, detectors, and synaptic optical links on silicon substrates to make an economically viable technology. This platform will be able to fire and detect neuron-like light-spiking (pulsed) signals at rates 1 billion times faster than biological neurons (>10 GHz per spike rates) and requiring ultralow energy (<10 fJ).

Digital rehabilitation competence and practice is needed to build the resilience of future rehabilitation systems.  Global need for rehabilitation is increasing due to population aging and increases in chronic health conditions, among other causes. WHO (2020), estimates that by 2050 over 2 billion people globally will need one or more assistive device at some point in their lives. Therefore, the need for cost-effective services and solutions for rehabilitation is evident. Digital transformation provides many opportunities, however many rehabilitation service providers and healthcare professionals in Europe and elsewhere, struggle using the new digital opportunities. The rehabilitation sector was strongly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of the challenges faced by the rehabilitation sector include the lack of technical knowledge, capacities, and didactical competencies in the application of digital rehabilitation. One of the main identified challenges in the adaption of new digital opportunities, is the access to relevant and evidence-based knowledge of which solutions to use or how to include digital rehabilitation into the scope of services provided. Another identified challenge is the general competence and capability of rehabilitation workforce to design use cases, with the users, for the existing digital solutions and for the different emerging technologies. Transnational cooperation in higher education offers an opportunity to develop competences on scale and to ensure access to required diverse digital knowledge in rehabilitation. The overall objective of this project is to contribute towards the resilience of rehabilitation systems through the development of digital rehabilitation competences of teachers, students and working life professionals. The specific objectives of the project include: 1) developing knowledge in digital rehabilitation for teachers, students and professionals for competence development in digital rehabilitation and, 2) increasing learning opportunities in digital rehabilitation through theory and evidence-based practice. These objectives will be achieved through developed Discussion papers, Framework, open pedagogical Handbook and a study Module with open on-line learning materials for the use of identified target groups in Europe and beyond.Above objectives will be achieved through active cooperation and networking. Different stakeholders are widely invited to contribute to the development work, including partners outside Europe, who will offer new expertise and reverse learning opportunities. Results will be widely disseminated through websites, social media, multiplier events and through new open learning opportunities. Directly, project engages around 300 rehabilitation experts in Europe. Indirectly, through dissemination and data collection activities, it is expected that over thousand people will be contributing to final outcomes. Transnational cooperation is essential in order to develop innovative rehabilitation practices to answer to the global challenges brought by COVID-19. Transnational cooperation ensures that partners are able to share their expertise in digital rehabilitation and to develop standards that go beyond remote and tele- rehabilitation initiatives.

This project is aimed to gather a set of researchers from four european universities with a wide experience in developing and deploying IT Governance (including ITG4U and dFogit) framework models from three different countries (Spain, Germany and Norway) to develop, adapt and test a new IT governance framework to be implemented in several Universities in Tunisia. Expected results of this project include a better governance model for IT in Tunisian HEIs as well as an overall modernization of the governance processes for HEIs and a contribution of the cooperation between EU and Tunisia.

However, current atmospheric models fail to represent most features of precipitation in the region, such as its distinctive strong diurnal cycle. Therefore, our knowledge of the physical processes initiating and propagating convective systems that generate precipitation in the Maritime Continent is very limited. In addition, the Maritime Continent is at a centre of interactions across scales, hence global model errors in this region propagate through the entire earth system and affect model estimates in remote regions too. This project is aimed at exploring our ability to simulate realistic precipitation by incorporating explicit convection and fine-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions in regional models. We will quantify the interplay between sea breeze circulation, ocean-atmosphere processes and convective systems to produce precipitation in the Maritime Continent and how it could change in the future. As such, this project will also advance our understanding of sea breeze and convective processes that are of major importance to a breadth of locations globally.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 170122.0, 'fundedAmount': 170122.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_______::bf7d9bc0068e9808a60836b8b0bf0482', 'code': '248497', 'acronym': 'TRIDENT', 'title': 'Marine Robots and Dexterous Manipulation for Enabling Autonomous Underwater Multipurpose Intervention Missions', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2010-03-01', 'endDate': '2013-02-28', 'callIdentifier': 'FP7-ICT-2009-4', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': None, 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 0.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda_____he::dda23b08dd5523e78589ea60a1e8696e', 'code': '101061455', 'acronym': 'G9MISSIONS', 'title': 'G9 GO FOR THE MISSIONS!', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2022-04-01', 'endDate': '2024-03-31', 'callIdentifier': 'HORIZON-MSCA-2022-CITIZENS-01', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': True, 'subjects': [\"European Researchers' Night 2022-2023\"], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The G9 GO FOR THE MISSIONS (G9MISSIONS) will be our 3rd experience as a consortium in managing the European Researchers’ Night in Spain, covering 40% of the Spanish territory.

The Covid pandemic has caused an acute crisis in these sectors, a crisis that makes the need for innovation manifest. The consortium has sought, already before the crisis, to contribute to the innovative needs of hospitality and tourism by strengthening the inquisitive skills of their students, thus allowing them to anticipate future disruptions in their profession. They have addressed this need by adopting Design Oriented Research methods.The overall aim of THETA is therefore to prepare students and professionals for a changing profession through immersive real-life learning experiences. In addition to in-company research and learning (options that are currently scarcely available), the project seeks to offer these experiences in versatile, virtual contexts for real-life learning, using AR/VR enabled learning spaces. These spaces, accessible through multiple platforms, in particular mobile phones, will be used to share content and learning experiences at four of the European top-notch universities.Far more than just an emergency solution, these Digital Learning Spaces open up new opportunities for real-life learning through active learner engagement and situated learning, independent from time and place, emulating how professionals in the future will collaborate. It will allow faculty, students and practitioner stakeholders to discuss real-life case studies and to explore possible solutions in a way that is not always possible in in-company settings, either because a case context is unavailable or inaccessible at a certain location, or because experimental solutions cannot be explored in those settings. Finally, it will allow these stakeholders to discuss the same case studies at different institutes and across borders, thus allowing for transnational learning experiences and incorporating a cross-cultural perspective.BEFORE the project hospitality students have learned management skills and hospitality subjects in class rooms, where neither hotel rooms nor customers are present, without the possibility to experience the effects of managerial interventions. AFTER this project the students are able to put their managerial skills and strategic insight into practice, by experiencing the effect of their decisions in, for example, hotel room design in mixed reality educational spaces (a.k.a. “caves”), where all walls are screens or can be used as such via using projectors, making it easy to try out different alternatives, discuss and co-create them with educators, peers and end users, and present the resulting concepts to client companies and other stakeholders.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;Tertiary hospitality programmes prepare students for management and executive positions in an international context. The strategic competences required for these positions have evolved rapidly in the last two decades, mostly as a result of this volatility. The THETA partners respond to these changes by educating their students as ‘Field Problem Solvers’, applying Design Oriented Research Methods. Through this approach the partners of THETA seek to ensure that their education maintains its professional relevance, allowing for vertical mobility rather than creating a divide between the professional discourse and knowledge at operational and managerial levels. Thus, the THETA partners aim to help hospitality students and professionals, the target groups of this project, anticipate future changes in the hospitality business by strengthening the so-called “21st century” skills —inquisitive power and creativity— for the future challenges of their profession. This educational approach is under threat as real-life learning and in particular internship opportunities have been decimated. The innovation of transforming education to address volatility with ‘field problem solving’, is jeopardised by the sudden transition to distance/hybrid learning. The overall aim of THETA is to prepare students and professionals for a changing profession by offering versatile, virtual contexts for real-life case studies, using the AR/VR enabled learning spaces. These spaces, accessible through multiple platforms, in particular mobile phones, will be used to share content and learning experiences at four of the European top-notch universities. In order to achieve this, we will develop 4 intellectual outputs aimed at students and staff of tertiary hospitality management programmes.The specific objectives are to:-Create accessible digital facilities for real-life learning from a Design Oriented Research perspective-Prepare future professionals for a volatile and dynamic environment-Develop digital pedagogical competences of educators-Develop digital, entrepreneurial and autonomous learning competencies-Develop high quality digital content-Share the knowledge of leading hospitality institutions with other schools, while building their own knowledge base thereby strengthening their leadership role.&lt;&lt; Implementation &gt;&gt;THETA envisions the creation of Learning Spaces using Extended reality (XR) as an effective technology for active and experiential learning, enabling users to gain concrete experience that might not otherwise be available. By providing \"\"hands-on\"\" experience, XR helps promote student engagement with learning materials and deepens student interaction with complex problems. These Learning Spaces must be accessible and useable at institutes in different environments and to all students without requiring special equipment other than those in regular use, such as mobile phones or tablets.The project will also develop pilot learning experiences that showcase how these Digital Learning Spaces can be used to address field problems using the Design Oriented Research Cycle. Similarly, the research potential of the Digital Learning Spaces will be illustrated by the development of a pilot research study where they will be used to test and assess simulated consumer experiences. Finally, an instructor resource package will be developed that will allow faculty at consortium partners as well as colleagues from other institutes and industry stakeholders to use not only the pilot materials, but also to use the experiences of the project to develop further courses and case studies.THETA will lead to 4 intellectual outputs:• IO1: AR/VR enabled Learning Spaces• IO2: Courses that make use of these spaces; in particular, a course on the use of Design Oriented Research that is to be followed by students of the participating schools, and potentially in the future by external students.• IO3: Research to be conducted making use of these spaces; the project envisions to create a pilot study around user preferences in sustainable hotel room measures;• IO4: Manual and training for faculty on creating Digital Learning Spaces and embedding Digital Learning Spaces in education.The XR (AR/VR) solutions will be implemented in each of the consortium partners to ameliorate student learning.As part of the project, we will organise one Learning, Teaching and Training activity as well as four Multiplier Events.&lt;&lt; Results &gt;&gt;Outcomes and impact THETA will have a clear impact on the different target groups of the project. The overall goal of THETA is to enhance the skill set of future graduates in hospitality management, widening the scope of the curriculum from current discipline knowledge and managerial skills to incorporate ‘21st century skills’, in particular those focusing on detecting and analysing new developments and trends, and on designing, implementing and critically assessing response strategies. In order to widen access to tertiary hospitality management programmes with Design Oriented Research as their ‘epistemological backbone’, digital AR/VR enabled learning spaces are developed. These spaces offer not just a temporary solution for a crisis situation, but a sustainable incorporation of digital learning, research and exchange into the activities of the partners.The specific path to achieve this ambitious goal is to develop world class online/blended learning that engages hospitality faculty, students and practitioners to address professional issues using a Design Oriented Management methodology. By creating a versatile virtual facility, they learn to analyse and solve emergent issues in the current and future professional environment of strategic hospitality management, in order to prepare participants as research informed problem solvers and innovators for the hospitality industry and society following the Design Oriented Research problem solving cycle.\"', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 271858.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::5e1f7e7b60c5f3bc55bd5d627eb1b918', 'code': '699260', 'acronym': 'BigData4ATM', 'title': 'Passenger-centric Big Data Sources for Socio-economic and Behavioural Research in ATM', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2016-05-09', 'endDate': '2018-05-08', 'callIdentifier': 'H2020-SESAR-2015-1', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': ['Data Science in ATM'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The Flightpath 2050 report envisages a passenger-centric air transport system thoroughly integrated with other transport modes, with the goal of taking travellers from door to door predictably and efficiently.

Adults (as teachers, parents, families, workers, and so on) are in charge of the social uses and regulation of data, both at home and in the education of the young people, and moreover, in most of our countries adults are legally responsible for their children's data. Furthermore, seniors encounter data in their daily lives, such as grandparents interacting with their families, and as citizens interacting with public services such as tax or health systems.DALI addresses the basic training of data literacy (i.e., supporting individuals in acquiring and developing basic skills and key competences) for adult learners in non-formal contexts, through the co-creation, piloting, and evaluation of pedagogical strategies and a toolkit of games and playful learning resources with adult learners, as well as methods for implementation with stakeholders that work with adult education. By taking a playful approach we attempt to increase learning demand and take-up through effective outreach, guidance and motivational strategies.A number of key stakeholders have already expressed interest in the project, and will take part both in testing and dissemination of results. Adults recruited from our associated partner organisations and individuals (politicians, seniors, students, unemployed, workers, parents, adult educators, etc.) and advertising campaigns will participate in a co-creation process, will pilot and evaluate the games and playful learning materials, adult educators will test the facilitator guide and, together with politicians, evaluate the policy recommendations and guidelines.

Originally designed as an above-ground garden to effectively compensate for the lack of cultivable land in urban areas, the micro-garden has proven to be suitable for other contexts, depending on multiple constraints: scarcity of land, climatic constraints, constraints social, etc.Too often perceived as a leisure for favored urban populations, the micro-garden is nevertheless potentially accessible to all types of populations, in particular the most economically fragile, because it can be carried out with recovery supports, requiring little investments and maintenance costs, and based on agricultural practices that are often easy to master once acquired.Thus, micro-gardening is a practice:- Ecological because economical in inputs (with cultivation methods mostly based on the principles of integrated pest management, plant associations), economical in water (less than 2l / d / m2 in temperate zones), favoring the reduction of gas greenhouse effects.- Promoting quality self-feeding: micro-gardening is fully in line with the current European trend of relocation and food autonomy, by allowing families to meet part of their food needs with quality products and of the season.- Accessible to all types of audiences with a little interest in gardening- Adapted to certain economic projects in urban or fragile areas: horticultural entrepreneurs can develop micro-gardening techniques to produce in remunerative quantities under conditions where cultivation in open fields is constrained.- Adapted to regions where physical or land constraints make agriculture difficult and limit food autonomy (humid tropical regions, desert or boreal regions).Ecological micro-gardening could ideally meet the needs of the poorest European populations, who are those who suffer the most from food insecurity and its consequences on health.BEST Microgardens aims to meet the needs identified with 4 distinct and complementary target groups:- Actors of social integration and the fight against poverty, including associations fighting against food insecurity: they are in demand for tools, methods and resources to promote diversification and food quality from their target audiences, prevent food insecurity and the resulting health problems, reduce dependence on food banks ...- People in precarious situations, which all European studies show are the most affected by both under and malnutrition, and who have almost no access to quality fruits and vegetables for economic reasons- People with a project for economic integration through agriculture, in particular in the outermost regions where local agriculture is based on a multi-activity model and little available land (Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, etc.) : they are in demand for techniques and methods that make it possible to strengthen and diversify their productions at a lower cost and adapted to their environmental constraints- Gardening associations which still have little mastery of ecological micro-gardening techniques and wish to strengthen their interventions in the direction of the most vulnerable populations.&lt;&lt; Objectives &gt;&gt;In direct response to the needs identified, the BEST Microgardens project will develop training and awareness tools to provide a concrete response:- the problems of insecurity and food imbalance of European populations in a situation of poverty and / or economic and social fragility. BEST Microgardens helps promote healthy and balanced diets through ecological micro-gardening, which is a healthy, economical, environmental technique that does not consume much space for people with limited means. Ecological micro-gardening makes it possible to promote self-nourishment with healthy and seasonal products, thus helping to solve the food problems of the most disadvantaged European populations, who are today the most subject to the risk of malnutrition.- promoters of economic integration projects centered on market gardening, in particular multi-active micro-entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector, who do not always have the investments and qualifications necessary to have agricultural land.

It makes it possible to establish complementarity between the different training approaches: distance learning and self-learning via digital resources, face-to-face group training under the guidance of trainers.2. BEST Microgardens (PR2) training content: these are aimed at identified audiences, especially people in a fragile social and economic situation, the social mediators who support them and their training organizations. They aim to train them to fully master ecological micro-gardening (from the \"\"construction\"\" of the garden to harvesting the products) but also address knowledge and skills to be predominantly environmental, social or economic (the best cost / efficiency in equipping a micro-garden, community micro-gardening practices, product valuation, marketing channels, etc.).3. The BEST Microgardens tutorial video library (PR3): made up of around twenty 4-minute videos, it promotes good practices, operating methods and testimonials from \"\"micro-gardeners\"\". An essential tool for training target audiences, it provides a concrete illustration of the content developed in production 2. It is accessible from the training platform, a specially created Youtube channel, and social networks.4. The BEST Microgardens (PR4) learning platform which is both:- A tool for promoting the project and its productions- An online training space accessible free of charge to target audiences with access to a computer. They will find training, videos, activities, exercises and skills assessment tools, and additional resources for their learning (link to resource organizations in their territory, link to other projects, other technical supports …).- Support for trainers (social mediators, gardening associations) who will be able to find all the training content and the trainer\\'s guide to facilitate the implementation of training.All productions are available in 6 languages \\u200b\\u200b(Ang, Esp, Fr, Gr, It, Sue)In addition, BEST Microgardens aims:- The training of 15 social workers mobilized during a transnational test training in Italy, in March 2023.

Climate change will also alter the plant diseases since the rate at which pathogens evolve and overcome host resistance may increase. Because abiotic factors such as temperature affect host susceptibility to pathogens and pathogen aggressiveness, interactions between plant resistance traits and abiotic stress tolerance may represent the most substantial impact of climate change on plant productivity. VitiSmart is a 3 years project with interdisciplinary research activities, structured with a well-balanced division between research and innovation, basic and applied research, field data collection and demonstration, socio-economic, technology transfer and dissemination actions, as well as management.

Their higher productivity potential arises from the operation of a Carbon Concentrating Mechanism (CCM), which is an effective ‘turbocharger’ of the assimilatory machinery. In recent years there has been a considerable drive towards engineering a CCM into C3 crops as a possible strategy to boost agricultural productivity. This emerged as an alternative strategy to the traditional breeding, which seem to be inadequate to ensure complete food and nutrient security in the face of global warming, population growth, and decreasing arable land availability. Advanced breeding of C4 plants is currently impinged on negatively by lack of knowledge of fundamental C4 physiology. This lack of fundamental knowledge calls for a  deeper understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of C4 photosynthesis and quantitative predictions of the effect of genetic manipulation.\\nFor C4 photosynthesis to operate, a substantial flow of metabolites is continuously exchanged between two partially isolated compartments in the leaf parenchyma (mesophyll and bundle sheath). This project (DILIPHO) hypothesizes that under low turgor the exchange of metabolites slows down, thus jamming the C4 machinery. DILIPHO consists of three phases. Firstly, the applicant Chandra Bellasio will learn concepts of advanced Mathematics and Biophysics, and develop a mechanistic model to study metabolite transport at leaf level, DILIMOD. Secondly, the hypothesis will be experimentally tested. In the hypothesis will be experimentally tested. Thirdly, the model will be interrogated to mechanistically explain the dataset and to answer fundamental questions in C4 ecology and physiology.

It will explore to what extent their experiences and works are informed by contemporary feminist discourses or, conversely, provide an opportunity to further and even interrogate feminist history and theory. FEMME relies on a multidisciplinary methodology (aesthetics, cultural studies, economics, history, sociology) to examine the cultural, aesthetic and political changes (or lack thereof) that women filmmakers and producers bring about within the media industries and popular culture in general. The project emphasizes the aim of feminism—that is, promoting equal opportunity for women—and points out the central tenets of gender and queer studies. It shows that feminism is not a monolithic theory but a place of diversity, debate and sometimes even discord within different contexts (ethnic, racial, cultural, national, etc.). Consortium members will thus observe the circulations of, and interactions between, various feminist sensibilities (post-feminism, intersectional feminism, materialist feminism, etc.) within British, French and US-American cinema and television. FEMME will chronicle women’s professional trajectories as filmmakers and showrunners to identify systemic causes of success and failure. Their films will provide first-hand material to rethink feminism in the wake of #MeToo and case studies of circulation on social media, in festivals and on streaming platforms. FEMME will look at the sociocultural and economic contexts of women’s film productions through a comparative approach that is particularly suited to the consortium members’ expertise. Its deliverables include academic events, open-access publications and cultural productions (a database recording women directors’ experiences in the industry and relation to feminism; an educational short film resulting from the collaboration between a woman filmmaker and academics); the project will also promote community engagements (e.g. public screenings) and seek exchanges with professionals (radio, festival organizers) to increase the collection of data and the circulation of the consortium members’ findings.

However as indicated by prior research there is an extensive margin for improvement in the digital readiness and capacity of HT enterprises which still rely heavily on traditional methods for communication and collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) implemented in an ad hoc, piecemeal manner.  At the other end of the spectrum, HE also needs to adapt to changes imposed by new technologies allowing for the shift towards digital learning.  It needs to cultivate the digital skills of students, enhance learning through digital technology and network sufficiently with the HEI stakeholders to achieve educational objectives and maximize the added value for all involved. The Covid-19 pandemic has accentuated the need for digital readiness, resilience and capacity in both HE and HTI and significantly impacted employer engagement efforts in HE. According to UNWTO in the unprecedented blow to the tourism sector witnessed, the pandemic has cut down not only tourist arrivals, but also put million positions at risk. HTI is one of the most adversely affected economic sectors.  Several measures to protect HTI employees &amp; ensure employment retention have been adopted e.g. digital training &amp; skills development, assisting tourism businesses’ digital transformation &amp; access to innovative tools (UNWTO, June 2020). In times of crisis, HTI has much to profit from online assistance by HEIs in a number of areas that will support the industry in mitigating &amp; dealing effectively with the adverse impacts such as: high quality information &amp; research for short- &amp; long-term solutions to problems &amp; issues, online HR development &amp; CPD activities for its employees, access to employment of students/graduates/unemployed, developing flexible career pathways and many more. HEIs on the other hand can greatly benefit from digital employer engagement under pandemic and other crises situations.  The importance of employer engagement in HE is extensively stressed in literature. HEIs offering programmes in HT can accrue numerous benefits from the systematic and holistic employer engagement which lies in the essence of its educational and research work. The Covid 19 pandemic stressed the need for digitalized employer engagement which will allow HEIs to involve employers in all aspects of their educational and research work in a systematic, modern but most importantly SAFE manner for all involved.  The HTI would be significantly aided by the development of an innovative platform that would facilitate digital communication, cooperation &amp; learning with HEIs, in order to proactively &amp; effectively deal with the adverse effects of the pandemic &amp; other crises. At the same time the educational and research work of HEIs offering programmes in HT &amp; the potential for their students/graduates would also be greatly supported &amp; enhanced, thus allowing for the continuation of the necessary investment in the HTI’s future human resource &amp; sustainable development at national, European and international levels.The digitalization of employer engagement between HE and HTI will address the needs of several disadvantaged groups of stakeholders that need equal access to the benefits of employer engagement by HEIs, especially in times of crisis.

Oestrogens have wide-ranging effects throughout life. In fish, like in other vertebrates, they primarily control sexual development, sex characteristics and reproduction. However, oestrogens also interact with the immune system in general and the developing immune system in particular. In mammals, it is well known that oestrogens regulate thymic development and thymic atrophy/involution and has complex roles in the regulation of T cell lymphopoiesis and T cell phenotypes as well as humoral and cell-mediated immunity. On the one hand, oestrogens have been shown to suppress lymphopoiesis, on the other hand antibody production can be stimulated by oestrogen. Thus, the immune system of mammals appears to respond to oestrogens both with stimulation and suppression. This project aims to evaluate the role of 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2), on thymus development and thymopoiesis in fish. It is hypothesised that (i) Variations in exogenous EE2 levels lead to precocious thymus atrophy/involution as could be observed in mammals. This will include examining which developmental stage is most sensitive to the EE2 impact. (ii) affect T cell lymphopoiesis (iii) disruption of normal thymus development and T cell lymphopoiesis has consequences on fish health by compromising immunocompetence and reducing pathogen resistance. Aspects of these questions will be investigated in two fish species with different developmental duration and reproductive strategies, the zebrafish and the seabass, respectively. Important parameters, such as sexual maturation, reproductive cycle and juvenile development will be taken into account. Stereological methods and genetic markers specific for thymocytes at different developmental stages as well as stromal cells will be employed to examine how the cellular composition within the thymus is altered by EE2. The distribution of different isoforms of oestrogen receptors (ERa, ß1, ß2 and GPER) will be detected and associated with the different thymic environments and cell types. Mechanisms of thymic atrophy will be elucidated further by testing whether EE2 acts directly on T cells and/or stromal cells via apoptosis, if maturing T cells are arrested in their development or if a loss of premature T cells from the thymus is the cause for possible decrease of cellularity. Secretome analyses on isolated stromal cells and T cells will reveal the paracrine signalling induced upon oestrogen activation of thymic cells. Eventually, it will be shown whether modifications of thymus size, structure and function following exposure to EE2 diminish the resistance of D. rerio and D. labrax to pathogen infection. This project will provide the first comprehensive analysis of possible disruptive effects of environmental EEDCs (example EE2) on thymus development and T cell differentiation in fish, as well as on the consequences for the pathogen resistance. In addition, it will be the first to test whether the immunodisruptive effects of EE2 take place in the same concentration range, which is required to cause disruptive effects in the reproductive system. In order to obtain broader insight into the immunological actions and consequences of environmental oestrogens, the project takes a comparative approach by using two fish species of contrasting life histories (zebrafish, sea bass). The project will substantially advance our understanding of risks associated with the potential immunodisruptive effects of environmental oestrogen for fish.

We propose to investigate Hg fluxes, speciation and transformation at 5 selected shallow and 3 deep hydrothermal vent systems to provide better constraints on the global Hg cycle and to study the incorporation and potential toxic effects on the ecosystem locally. A better understanding of hydrothermal Hg flux and microbial production of neurotoxic methylmercury is important to quantify the human impact on Hg cycling and exposure.

These systems will locally modify the vibrations of the structure at their resonant frequencies, thus creating a random frequency dispersion of the diffracted sound field. The acoustic field diffracted by the periodic stiffeners is blurred and attenuated so that the structure becomes stealth at low and very low-frequency. FARAON also proposes to define optimum devices to make stealth a metallic cylindrical shell at very low frequency in operational conditions. This research project is motivated by the very promising results obtained through first calculations based on a theoretical formalism that gives the acoustic field diffracted by a ribbed finite cylindrical shell with axisymmetric oscillators [1]. These results show the possibility of realizing devices that make stealth a target and having relatively small thicknesses at very low-frequency. To reach this ambitious objective, the FARAON project is divided into 3 workpackages. The selection of the shape of the structure and the classic or metamaterials for the resonant system, is performed in the first workpackage. The theoretical and experimental validity of the device is made in the second workpackage with metallic plates in air and in water. Finally theoretical models are elaborated from the results obtained previously, to define the optimal device for a metallic finite cylindrical shell at low and very low-frequency in the last workpackage.

However, the inability to efficiently produce complex and/or large composite structures limits their diffusion in terms of fields of applications. The actual trend in the composite industry focused on high performance materials for aeronautic applications is to produce larger and larger parts with increasing geometrical complexity and number of integrated functions. This project perfectly fits in the general problematic of understanding the multi-physic mechanisms involved during both the forming phase of composite materials and the processing one using LCM (Liquid Composite Moulding) processes. This project will allow to realise a real technological breakthrough by developing three 'new' LCM processes: 1. New LCM process applied to 3D non-periodic materials 2. New LCM process applied to non-developable (highly deformed) shapes 3. New LCM process applied to axisymetric shapes and ablative materials Furthermore, this project will also consists in a real scientific breakthrough as actually, there is no available numerical code which allows to link the multi-scale aspects of the aimed processes (forming and LCM) together with the coupling between fluid and solid deformations as well as the prediction of micro and macro voids formation. The main contribution from this innovative numerical tool concerns the analysis of non-periodical heterogeneous mediums coming from the new concept of 'by-design' 3D materials as well as the accurate investigation of the particular defects arising from the combination of these materials and their production means. In addition, new thermoplastic matrix will be taken into account and finally, the foreseen benefits might be used by a much broader range of industries than just the aeronautic ones. Moreover, this approach on the accurate numerical simulation of processes will have to (partially) fulfil the existing gap between mechanical and process simulation. Indeed, due to cultural and scientific reasons, process and mechanical aspects of the composites are generally treated as two distinct problems even tough the process parameters greatly influence the final properties of the material. Our procedure will act as the missing link allowing a multi-scale approach from the process up to the mechanical properties determination: the heterogeneities will not any more be treated with simplistic hypothesis before structure calculation, but rather directly from a precise modelisation of both forming and injection processes to take into account the defects generated during the whole process by integrating non-periodical aspect of the reinforcement as well as the fluid-solid interactions. Furthermore, this will permit to chose and adapt the processes by defining structural health and geometrical criteria. Finally, the complementarities together with the diversity of the partners of this consortium, leading aeronautic industrials, specialised SME in simulation and well established laboratories covering all the aspects of the project constitute a very strong guarantee that convincing results will be produced throughout the course of this project.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 918351.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'anr_________::d8d34c468d444a5deccf9145de0f54b6', 'code': 'ANR-08-BLAN-0331', 'acronym': 'ROBOCOOP', 'title': None, 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2009-01-01', 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'ANR', 'name': 'French National Research Agency (ANR)', 'jurisdiction': 'FR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The topic of this project is the design of cooperative approaches for robust-scheduling in a perturbed environment and their evaluation. These approaches are suitable in a lot of application fields such as production scheduling, project scheduling, grid computing, robotic activities planning, healthcare management, etc. In such environments, the execution of a schedule is highly perturbed by nature. The characteristics of activities, the temporal constraints, the resource constraints are time dependent and contingent. Therefore, building up schedules able to face a given range of uncertainties while keeping the performance under control is of prime importance with regard to the efficiency of the organization. On the other hand, because of the recent and significant progresses observed in information technologies, one can notice, in most of the previously evoked applicative fields, the development of network organization where decisions are distributed over the decision centres of the network, each one having its own decisional autonomy. This important mutation justifies the design of robust-scheduling approaches which do not consider scheduling as a centralized function any more, but rather as a cooperative function, provided that the scheduling decision arise from a clever cooperation between the different decision centres of the network. The ROBOCOOP project aims at studying, from a theoretical viewpoint, the problem of robust and cooperative scheduling, taking advantage of the various centralized robust-scheduling techniques already developed by the project partners. On the one hand, we intend to show how using robust scheduling techniques inside each decision centre can enhance the efficiency of a cooperation process, while favoring the emergence of a global organization being itself robust. On the other hand, because already existing robust-scheduling techniques have often been designed for facing a particular kind of uncertainty, we want to study how such techniques can cooperate together for providing more robust schedules. Another core topic of the ROBOCOOP project is the design and the development of evaluation tools. The aim is, apart from the evaluation of the cooperative scheduling techniques which have been previously presented, to fill an important gap that characterize robust-scheduling: the absence of evaluation tools allowing, at an international scale, the evaluation and the comparison of robust-scheduling procedures. Indeed, while some well-known scheduling problem libraries are available for comparing deterministic scheduling procedures, there does not exist any equivalent data base for robust scheduling. Yet one know how such evaluation tools favor the international competition, allow to objectively compare the efficiency of procedures and stimulate the development of more and more effective robust approaches. That is why the ROBOCOOP project aims at offering, on a totally open web site which will report the best of robust scheduling techniques, a complete evaluation chain allowing the international community to test and compare their approaches.

An untapped database (Lloyd's) on the merchant marine fleet navigation from 1880 to nowadays will allow us to construct the global maritime network. Extracting road and railway segments from old and recent maps will serve to build the land-based network. Both networks will be combined and fed by the harmonisation of four urban databases on cities' population since 1880.

This resulted in a highly persistent contamination of soils, water and living organisms. In freshwater environments, crustaceans present high concentrations of chlordecone in their organs. Therefore, more severe controls have been made on farms that produce the giant river prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). As the result, the analysis showed that, in several aquaculture farms of Guadeloupe and Martinique, chlordecone levels in the shrimps was over the maximal limit of residues established at 20 µg/kg. Up to now, the studies designed to tackle this problem only addressed the level of contamination of freshwaters and crustaceans, and empirically observed changes in populations of aquatic animals (crustaceans and fish) in contaminated rivers. Many questions remained unsolved regarding the route of entry of chlordecone in the shrimps, on the bioavailability of the compound in freshwater ecosystems, and the capabilities of the shrimps to biotransform and eliminate residues. In addition, intoxication mechanisms which could results in chlordecone-induced alterations of the nervous and endocrine systems remain poorly understood in these invertebrates, so that specific biomarkers of exposure and toxic effects are not available yet. In the MACHLOMA project, which will benefit of interactions with aquaculture farms in Guadeloupe, we propose to use Macrobrachium rosenbergii as a model species to increase the knowledge on (i) the mechanisms of bioconcentration/bioaccumulation of chlordecone, by comparison with the concentrations measured in environmental matrices (water, sediments, particulate materials), (ii) the enzymatic mechanisms of detoxication and depuration of chlordecone, and (iii) the mechanisms of neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption, which are known to occur in mammals. Experiments will be performed (i) in control and contaminated ponds used for shrimp production in local aquaculture farms and (ii) in the laboratory, in order to build concentration-response relations based on environmental realistic exposure concentrations (which can reach 0.5 to 10 µg/L in some locations). Integration of the information acquired on these mechanisms will be facilitate by the use of the same individuals for both residue measurements, detoxication/depuration studies, and effects analysis. Acquisition of a sound knowledge on the fate and effects of chlordecone in M. rosenbergii will be of primary importance (i) to contribute to solve the problem the aquaculture is currently facing in the French West Indies and to propose solutions to maintain this activity which is important in the local economy, and (ii) to identify relevant biomarkers that could be transferred to species naturally present in rivers (e.g., Macrobrachium faustinum) and used for risk assessment and remediation in natural freshwater ecosystems.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 290002.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'anr_________::57429be2c972e5b169048dc656c8bc46', 'code': 'ANR-05-BLAN-0003', 'acronym': 'calixzymeredox', 'title': None, 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2005-12-02', 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'ANR', 'name': 'French National Research Agency (ANR)', 'jurisdiction': 'FR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 77084.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'anr_________::6d27664a898c0d5b22fb129bea5bb7e0', 'code': 'ANR-21-ESRE-0014', 'acronym': 'TERRA-FORMA', 'title': None, 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2021-05-01', 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'ANR', 'name': 'French National Research Agency (ANR)', 'jurisdiction': 'FR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': None, 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 9602900.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'anr_________::1251e53ead9721ac7ec86a02cc785198', 'code': 'ANR-23-PEA3-0002', 'acronym': 'ICAT', 'title': 'Construction Engineering and Spatial Planning', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2023-09-01', 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'ANR', 'name': 'French National Research Agency (ANR)', 'jurisdiction': 'FR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'The \"Construction and Territorial Development Engineering (ICAT)\" project that we are proposing is part of this approach and aims to structure two complementary training courses around sustainable construction and the rational development of cities and territories.

The previous results obtained within the MOREST project and the in-situ detection of high concentrations in pesticides during oyster gametogenesis, justify the need to focus our study on the toxic effects of pesticides in this commercially important bivalves. From the results obtained by the analysis of two historical series of data concerning (1) harnessing, reproduction and survival of oyster larvae (Rémora networks) and (2) the level of genomic abnormalities in natural naissain, the GIMEPEC project propose a genetic basement to explain a loss of oyster resistance in physiological and environmental stress. Damage to oyster genome could result from a genotoxic impact following pesticide exposure. This damage (structural DNA lesions, irreversible chromosomal lesions) could be responsible for a decrease in oyster fitness in terms of physiological performances (growth, survival, immunity and reproduction). Because it can be excluded that effects could be transmitted from one generation to another, the trans-generationnal effects of pesticides will be particularly explored. To achieve its research program, the GIMEPEC project is based on pluridisciplinary skills in ecotoxicology, cytogenetics, physiology, immuno-pathology, conchyliculture and environmental chemistry. The project is made of two different complementary approaches: an experimental approach and a field approach. During the experimental approach realised in the experimental hatchery of Ifremer, oysters will be exposed to both glyphosate and one of its commercial formulation, roundup, during the gametogenesis process in order to study their genotoxic effects and their possible vertical transmission to the descent. Another set of experiments will be realised by exposing oysters during the embryo-larval stage of development, known to be sensitive to genotoxicant exposure. During these experiments, structural and functional alterations to the genome will be studied thanks to the application of cytogenetic techniques and genotoxicity tests, and by a transcriptomic study (DGE approach). The biotransformation of the selected herbicides will be also studied by the measurement at molecular and biochemical level of markers of phase II and III of the biotransformation process and of antioxidant defences. Different biological markers will be also measured in order to study the potential embryotoxic, immunotoxic (expression levels of maker genes of immunocompetence, detection of immunopathological lesions, cellular alterations of immunocompetence) and reprotoxic (histological analysis, esterification of sexual steroids) effects of glyphosate and roundup. These experimental experiments will be completed by a field approach in order to study the effects of environmental conditions on the development, growth and physiological performances (immunity, survival, reproduction) of naissains from early and late spawning. This field study will be realised at the site of Fouras (Marennes Oléron).

Protozoa are currently detected by immunofluorescence (IF), except T. gondii, on samples from filtered water. Limitations have been identified for both the IF detection method (requires antibodies, high-level expertise, etc.) and the matrix (water). The use of the water matrix to monitor the contamination level of water bodies gives variable results that depend on physico-chemical and meteorological parameters that are particularly important in the present context of global climate change. This could represent a limitation when applying a monitoring approach based on this matrix. Bioaccumulation measurements of these protozoa in invertebrate species, mainly bivalve molluscs, could represent an alternative tool to evaluate water contamination and avoid the limitations due to the water matrix. They would also break away from current approaches to protozoa research. Advantages would be the integrative (temporal) character of pathogen loads in invertebrates and the representativeness of pathogen measurements according to site (attached organisms). For us to have tools applicable on a large spatial scale (freshwater-seawater continuum), two bivalve mollusc species will be considered: a coastal one (the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis), and a continental one (the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha). Using the capacity of our indicator species to accumulate parasites as a tool requires overcoming various scientific challenges by answering questions centred around three main issues: 1- It is necessary to develop and validate a sensitive procedure for simultaneous protozoa extraction and detection, and strict quantification of protozoa (oo)cysts in a complex matrix such as bivalve molluscs. The consortium proposes to develop innovative, rapid and sensitive molecular approaches, with special focus on the crucial step of (oo)cyst extraction/purification from molluscs. 2- It will be necessary to determine whether the parasite loads measured in zebra mussel and blue mussel tissues are correlated with the levels of contamination. To that end, the consortium proposes to define the kinetics of protozoa bioaccumulation by bivalves during single or combined exposures under laboratory conditions. 3- The physiology of mussels, in link with environmental and endogenous parameters, could modify their capacity to accumulate pathogens. The MOBIDIC project proposes to investigate the potential effect of environmental parameters (temperature, food availability, chemical stress) on pathogen bioaccumulation. In addition, in light of the lack of data in the literature, the project proposes to investigate the potential effects of (oo)cysts on mussel’s health, particularly on immune responses. This project proposes to provide new knowledge about interactions between protozoa (Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis., and T. gondii) and mussels, with the aim to define a reliable indicator of the biological quality of water bodies to preserve the quality of water resources and protect human health. The MOBIDIC project will also provide interesting data in ecotoxicology in a multi-stress context, i.e. cumulative/interacting effects between biological and chemical contaminants, to better estimate the risk related to global climate change. To achieve the different objectives, a multidisciplinary consortium will associate environmental sciences (ecotoxicology and ecophysiology) and the fields of health (parasitology) on the one hand, and academic, institutional and private partners to combine basic and applied research and transfer skills to stakeholders, on the other hand.

Over the past 4 years, exploratory work has been carried out to formalise methodological perspectives and put them to the test on a limited panel of coins. The contribution of the life sciences is crucial, both for the classification methodology and for the quality of the works made available to the scientific community. The aim of the ClaMoMed project is threefold: (1) to establish consolidated numismatic classification standards, (2) to carry out a scientific classification of a large panel of medieval coins (5th-15th centuries) from the current French area using digital tools, (3) to complete a publishing project designed to invent and produce new tools providing easy access to rigorous information on these coins. The partnership formed for this project brings together medieval numismatists from the teams of three French UMRs (CRAHAM, IRAMAT, IDEES) and France's leading archaeological operator (INRAP), as well as the Digital Document Unit of the MRSH in Caen and the Presses universitaires de Caen.\", 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 0.0, 'fundedAmount': 555582.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'corda__h2020::6bd1828e544c72c19a85618948c0d0c6', 'code': '811363', 'acronym': 'COLLEXISM', 'title': 'Collisional excitation of interstellar molecules: towards reactive systems', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2019-07-01', 'endDate': '2025-06-30', 'callIdentifier': 'ERC-2018-COG', 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': ['ERC Consolidator Grant'], 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'EC', 'name': 'European Commission', 'jurisdiction': 'EU', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Accurate determination of physical conditions of interstellar molecular clouds is a crucial step to better understand the life cycle of the interstellar matter and particularly the formation of stars and planets as well as the synthesis of organic molecules that may lead to emergence of life in the universe. A key parameter for the determination of these conditions from interstellar spectra is the calculation of accurate collisional rate coefficients of interstellar molecules with the most abundant species (H, He, H2 and e-). Whereas the knowledge of collisional processes has reached a certain level of maturity for collisions involving non-reactive molecules, very few reliable data exist for collisions involving reactive radicals and ions. The computation of such data is a real challenge since inelastic and reactive processes compete during collisions. In this project, we plan to overcome this complex problem and to provide collisional data for these radicals and ions in order to derive as much information as possible from the molecular spectra collected by current telescopes. As it is hardly possible to consider both collisional and reactive processes simultaneously, we will set up a new methodology based on quantum approach that allows obtaining accurate data. We will focus on molecular hydrides that are good candidates because of both their astrophysical importance and their quantum accessibility. We will carry out the determination of interaction potentials using quantum chemistry ab initio methods while the treatment of the dynamics of the nuclei will primarily be done using quantum time-independent reactive and non-reactive approaches. When exact quantum calculations will not be usable, innovative statistical quantum mechanical methods will also be explored. The new data will then be used in radiative transfer models and the predictions will be finally compared to observations in order to derive the abundances of reactive radicals with unprecedented accuracy.', 'granted': {'currency': 'EUR', 'totalCost': 1802620.0, 'fundedAmount': 1802620.0}, 'h2020Programmes': None}, {'id': 'anr_________::eb0e9e1980834e4b5d81e579663388b1', 'code': 'ANR-11-INSE-0006', 'acronym': 'MAGIC-SPS', 'title': 'Guaranteed Methods and Algorithms for Integrity Control and Preventive Monitoring of Systems', 'websiteUrl': None, 'startDate': '2011-10-01', 'endDate': None, 'callIdentifier': None, 'keywords': None, 'openAccessMandateForPublications': False, 'openAccessMandateForDataset': False, 'subjects': None, 'fundings': [{'shortName': 'ANR', 'name': 'French National Research Agency (ANR)', 'jurisdiction': 'FR', 'fundingStream': None}], 'summary': 'Current systems must show autonomous capabilities that allow them to remain operational possibly in a degraded but safe mode even when occur a fault, a failure or any other disturbance. To achieve such an objective, current modern systems often embed software and hardware that allow them to detect in an automatic and autonomous way the need of switching to the degraded mode, and either to proceed with the necessary corrective actions to resume normal operational mode or remain in a degraded but safe one. One of the main challenges that must be addressed is how to take into account the uncertainties that act on the embedded system and that may be induced by measurement errors, loose conception, faults, or ageing, … Uncertainties are said unstructured when system model is not completely known, and said structured when the known model encompasses uncertain parameters or variables. For both cases, it is usually difficult to come out with a precise modelling for the statistical properties of the uncertainties, with the consequence that fault detection and isolation approaches based on statistical analysis techniques may become irrelevant. The first objective of MAGIC-SPS project is to investigate in a thorough manner computational techniques applicable to the fault detection and isolation and the monitoring of systems subject to bounded error uncertainties, that is uncertainties that remain within a bounded set, with known bounds but otherwise unknown. We will address fault detection and isolation and the preventive monitoring of both time-continuous and hybrid continuous-discrete dynamical systems with bounded uncertainties. To do so, we will study modelling approaches and model identification techniques for such uncertain systems in the bounded error framework. We will also investigate their structural properties among which parameter identifiability and fault diagnosticability. Set membership techniques for fault detection and isolation have benefited recently from a large number of works and have shown significant progress. Nevertheless, they still show a main shortcoming: the propagation of spurious uncertainty due to over-approximations in set computation results, which yields algorithms with exponential complexity hence long computation time. MAGIC-SPS project aims to (1) further the capabilities of current guaranteed methods for nonlinear continuous reachability computation, hence come out with scalable methods for nonlinear continuous reachability computation in presence of bounded uncertainty; (2) develop guaranteed and efficient set membership techniques for hybrid reachability computation in presence of bounded uncertainty; (3) use the above to develop methods for preventive monitoring of both continuous and hybrid dynamical systems in presence of bounded uncertainty. We will also investigate the feasibility of fault prognosis by using set membership state and parameter estimation techniques.
